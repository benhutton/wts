# Lecture 4 - Revelation

* General revelation is not specific enough to reveal Jesus, but is specific enough to leave us guilty before God
* What does it mean to be "Image of God" after the fall?
  * We still know God
  * God is revealer and he makes sure that his revelation gets through
* Ecclesiastes 3:10-11 - eternity is in the heart of man
  * Our understanding of God is embedded in who we are
* Romans 1:19 - that which is known about God is the truth about God's character
  * This is clearly seen and understood
  * Image of God means knowers of God - basic to who we are
  * God's revelation is clear and God makes sure we get it
  * We then undermine and pervert it to get it out of our thoughts and out of our lives
  * Which of course we cannot do because we remain in the image of God
  * Barrier of sin must be broken for us to acknowledge that natural revelation is revelation
  * We have special revelation in the context of general revelation
* What kind of knowledge is this?
  * Immediate or mediate?
    * Scientia is thought to be the highest form of knowledge (aristotle's syllogism: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal)
    * Mediate knowledge - acquired by inference
    * Immediate knowledge - true on the basis of what it says w/o the process of inference
  * Reformed scolastics
    * Implanted knowledge (cognitio insita)
      * Reject the notion of innate knowledge
        * Innate knowledge had home in Cartesian knowledge
        * Was autonomous knowledge - have it by virtue of who we are
      * Knowledge is innate, but because of what God does in and through us, NOT because of who we are
      * Knowledge of God written on the hearts of men (Romans 2)
    * Acquired knowledge (cognitio acquisita)
      * God reveals that which we acquire
    * These are distinctions, not meant to be separate; have to do with the mode of knowledge
    * Both cases, God actively gives it
    * True theology (theologia vera)
      * Developed from natural revelation by someone regenerate (seeing things through the grid of special revelation)
    * False theology (theologia falsa)
      * Developed from natural revelation by someone unregenerate
  * Bertrand Russell 
    * We can know something simply by it being present/belonging to experience - no need to reflect on its properties
    * Doesn't need to be inferential in order to be known
    * Knowledge by acquaintance/presence
  * Romans 1 - "Eternal power and deity is clearly seen"
    * Eternal power - reference to God's character as one who acts
    * Deity - God's godness
    * Hodge - if Paul wanted to delineate specific attributes, he would have done that, but the way he does it he is thinking of "all the divine perfections"
    * Creation itself reveals all the divine perfections
    * Power transcends everything that is created
    * Dynamic, on going understanding of who God is
    * We understand that God is not mundane
    * Implications for worship
      * If it is God who we worship, if we are to be seeker sensitive, then we need to maintain the transcendence and holiness of God, NOT the mundane and day to day
      * Bad idea: do what they do on the other 6 days
      * People instinctively know that God is transcendent and different, and people who do not know Christ need to see that
      * People who don't know Christ already know God and know him as a transcendent and holy God

## Special Revelation

* Revelation is God's condescension/accomodation to us
  * Even God speaking is an accomodation of God
  * God makes himself know by stooping down and lisping in baby talk
  * God takes on characteristics that he didn't have to take on in order to communicate to us, to reveal himself to us
  * Reveals himself to us in reference to created things to highlight who he is 
    * Psalm 90:1-2 - "Before the mountains were brought forth"
    * Job 11:7-9 - "Higher than heaven, deeper than sheol" - God transcends what creation is
  * God existed "before" creation, even though there was no "before" until there was creation
* Before the Fall, God told Adam and Eve how to please him
  * After the Fall, God gave them a promise that there would be one who would provide redemption
* Hebrews 1:1-2 - "In these last days he has spoken to us by his Son"
  * Context: who best represents God's condescension? Angels, Moses, Priesthood?
    * Hebrews is one long defense that Jesus is the great High Priest
  * Makes very clear that Jesus is fully God and has condescended and has spoken
* Change takes place from pre-fall to post-fall yet both are covenantal and God condescends in both
  * Covenant = relationship to God
  * In that relationship, God reveals himself and makes his will known
* Before the fall, we have indication that fellowship with God will take place
* After the fall, change in us and our natures
  * Prior to the fall, we had the ability to sin or not sin
  * After, only able to sin - Romans 3:10-18
    * This is what we want - our will is directed by our nature; we want to do what we can do, and what we can do is sin
    * Total Depravity
    * Because we are dead, we cannot move toward God. We don't have the ability to reach out and grab something as we're drowning
    * We are like Lazarus in the grave
    * 1 Cor 2:14 - the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God... they are Spiritually discerned
      * Spiritually discerned is Holy Spirit discerned
      * Special revelation cannot be known by those apart from the Spirit
      * Natural man cannot accept the things of the Spirit because he only wants to sin
* We need special revelation in terms of redemption now, NOT just in terms of the knowledge of God

## Christ as Revelation

* Ridderbos - "the confession of Christ as the Son of God, in the supra- and pre-historical sense of the word" - Christ is the 2nd person of the Trinity
  * Christ as Image of God refers to the pre-existant one in his divine glory
  * Image of God = eternal relationship of the Father to the Son
  * Redemptive historical is always grounded in the ontological - that which transcends the redemptive historical
  * Must maintain God as God - he is who he is - then he acts in a particular way in history that is consistent with his character
  * OT is the preface to the NT - provides sufficient and necessary introduction to what is to come
  * John 5:39-47 - "You search the Scriptures... it is they that bear witness about me... if you believed Moses, you would believe me for he wrote of me"
    * There's enough in the OT to know that when Jesus comes, that he is the Messiah
  * Luke 1:67-75 - Zechariah knew that what was happening was a fulfillment of the OT prophecies and that his own son was to prepare the way for the coming Messiah
  * John 8:51-59 - Jesus identifies himself with YHWH of the OT; Jews try to stone him
    * Don't view the OT saints as if they don't have enough info to expect the Messiah or to know Jesus or see him when he came
  * Always view revelation in light of other revelation you have
    * OT is supposed to be read Christianly from the perspective of the NT
  * John 14:6-11 - When Jesus is here in the flesh, he is the revelation of God
  * Hebrews 1:3-4 - "He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature"
    * Son is from the Father - always a "fromness" quality
      * Christ as the revelation
      * Christ reveals God because he is from God while being fully God
      * Person is derivative; deity is not derivative
  * Col 2:8-9 - fullness of deity dwells bodily
    * Why rely on human tradition and philosophy when God has seen fit to condescend to reveal himself and his wisdom in his Son
      * God's wisdom has come to show you what true wisdom is
    * Wisdom is now in Scripture








"At this point that's the least of his worries... because he's dead. I don't mean to make light of that... Russell found out how wrong he was. Had to be a shock to him."
"You don't need to believe them, but as you become more sanctified you will"
"Heaven is just a bus stop"
