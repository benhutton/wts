# Introduction (Continued)

* Knowledge of God is the heart of our Christian growth
  * Colossians 1:9-10: "filled with the knowledge of his will... so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord"
    * Link between holiness and knowledge of God
    * God is holy and transcendent, we are creatures, sinners, and need to be redeemed
    * Moves us to what God has done for us in Christ
    * Increasing in the knowledge of God is the most important thing as Christians
    * Christian life feels mundane and boring when knowledge of God wanes
    * Obedient for the sake of obedient => lackluster Christian life
    * Obedience for Christ  motivates Christian lives
  * 2 Peter 1:2: "May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord"
    * Christ brought peace while we were at war with our creator in our sinfulness
  * Knowledge of God is not head knowledge but whole-soul knowledge of God that includes head knowledge
    * Need to "Love the Lord with your mind", but not abstracted from everything else
* 3 elements of faith = knowledge, assent, trust
  * Faith must include knowledge in a Biblical way - NOT blindly
  * You know something about who Christ is and what he has accomplished
  * "The problem is that we think stupidity is to be glorified"
* "What matters in the last analysis is not that I know God but that he knows me." - Packer
  * God determined in eternity past to set his redeeming love on us
  * Then worked out history to redeem us
  * We should be amazed by this continually and want to please God in how we live, think, and speak
    * Missing part of Christianity for our generation is holiness
    * Probably too much emphasis on Christian experience and things like that (relativism in Christian culture)

# A Proper Approach

* Kaufman in "God, the Problem" - if nothing in our experience can be directly identified as "God", what meaning does or can the word have?
  * Needed to just open the Bible to see that God has revealed himself
  * Biblically speaking, God has entered our experience
    * Did this in the beginning - don't need to hunt or turn to cryptic passages
    * There in the Garden, after the Fall, all through redemptive history
    * God enters our experience and makes himself known
  * Of course, this doesn't mean that God is NOT transcendent
    * God remains transcendent while he reveals himself to us
  * If philosophers are to write articles and books about God, they ought to see what God has said about those things first of all
* Theology teaches God, is taught by God, and leads to God - Aquinas
  * God revealing himself to tell us who he is
* Man's mind, full as it is of pride and boldness, dares to imagine a god according to its own capacity; as it sluggishly plods, indeed is overwhelmed with the crassest ignorance, it conceives an unreality and an empty appearance as God. - Calvin
  * We will talk about the character of God in a way that doesn't fit our intellectual categories
  * Only way out is to realize that God won't fit our intellectual categories
  * Can be understood but not exhaustively comprehended
* NOT the case that we do as much as we can and end up with a mystery
* INSTEAD we start out with a mystery, then God reveals some things about himself
  * We can know truly
  * First confession is Romans 11:33-36
  * Doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation are mysterious
  * NOT obvious to most philosophers and theologians
* Ebenezer Gay - preached 69 years in MA in 1700s; became first Unitarian minister
  * Decided that if he couldn't understand it, it couldn't be true
  * First rejected federal headship of Adam
  * Eventually rejected Trinitarianism
  * Slow drift - need to keep checking ourselves in terms of the things that we're thinking
* John Locke wrote "The Reasonableness of Christianity"
  * Read NT and accepted only the things that made sense to him
  * God is good and there might be a mediator
* Deuteronomy 29:29 - secret things belong to God, the things revealed belong to us
  * Some things belong to God alone - he doesn't owe us an explanation
  * God does what he pleases; everything he does is right and true; our reponsibility is to accept that and grow in it
  * "All theology is mystery" -- Bavinck
* "All wrong thoughts of God... must cast a shadow over the soul that entertains them... All defective views of God's character tell upon the life of the soul and the peace of the conscience." - Bonar
  * "We must thinnk right thoughts of God if we would worship him as he desires to be worshiped"
  * Need to be as meticulous as possible, yet realize that we won't be able to plumb the depths of it
  * Needs to be a whole-soul effort - not just intellectual
* Proper approach to knowing God is to know him according to his revelation
  * Doxology is the goal of this
* Romans 1:24-25 - God gives those who suppress truth in unrighteousness up to impurity such that they exchange truth for a lie and worship creature rather than creator
  * Usually worship ourselves or worship God
  * Doctrine should flow into doxology, and out of doxology should come Christian living (Romans 11:33-12:1)
* Psalm 27:4 - One thing have I asked of the Lord - that I may be in the presence of God all the days of my life
  * Want to see who God is in all of his beauty/majesty/glory
  * See this in revelation
  * Picture of intimate fellowship with God that has something to do with how we know God
* When writers of the Psalms are in trouble, they go to God's character
  * Psalm 51:1 - according to mercy and love... blot out my transgressions
    * Because of God's character, not because its God's job
  * Psalm 57:1-3 - David's prayer is appealing to God's character
    * A study of the doctrine of God is a study of how to pray

# The Revelation of God

* WCF 7.1 - need to write this verbatim on the final
  * "The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto Him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of Him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God's part, which He hath been pleased to express by way of covenant."
  * Distance between God and creature
    * Transcendence of God, his "otherness" (not spatial distance)
    * Ontological distance/difference
      * Fundamental difference between the being of God and the being of anything else
    * Existence that is eternal and not anywhere (not subject to spatial categories)
  * Voluntary condescension
    * God freely determined to act in a particular way, including creating 
    * God comes down by taking on attributes and characteristics in order to interact with us (not meaning that he is occupying a space where he was not previously)
      * Jesus takes on human nature
      * See foreshadowing as God condescends from creation onward to interact, reveal, speak, and redeem
  * Covenantal continuity and discontinuity
    * History is covenantal into eternity
* Natural Revelation
  * Psalm 19:1 - The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
    * Speech language ("declare", "proclaim")
    * Creating is a kind of non-verbal communication from God
      * Existence of non-verbal communication is obvious
    * God says something about himself in and through creation
    * God has never left himself without a witness to himself since he has always revealed himself in creation (humans and otherwise)
  * Genesis 1:1, John 1:1 - in the beginning the Word created
    * Christ was involved as creator and revealer
    * Gives life and light through creation; focus on the Son
    * One for all and all for one - the works of the Trinity are indivisible yet terminate on a particular person
      * Work of Christ is the work of the Trinity terminating on Christ
  * Genesis 1:26-27 - God created man in his own image
    * Creating something that will image God's own character in a way that nothing else had
    * Man is concise revelation of who God is
    * Image of God remains even after the Fall
      * Distorted and perverted
      * Not obliterated
    * 1 Cor 11:7 - man is image and glory of God
    * James 3:9
    * Only things linked to breath of God in redemptive history are life of man and word of God
    * Judgment remains b/c responsibility remains, b/c ________________________
    * When we move from being in Adam to being in Christ, the image of God takes on a restorative character
  * "If the cosmos is the theater of revelation, in this theater man is both actor and spectator" - Kuyper
  * "No one can look upon Himself without immediately turning his thoughts to the contemplation of God, in whom he 'lives and moves'. For quite clearly, the mighty gifts with which we are endowed are hardly from ourselves; indeed, our very being is nothing but subsistence in the one God." - Calvin I.1.1
    * Institutes is sort of Calvin's commentary on Romans
  * Romans 1:32 - "Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them."
    * In natural revelation, we know something of what God would require of us, and that if we violate those revelations we deserve to die
    * Most nonchristians will acknowledge sin (though they might quibble about specifics)
  * Acts 17:28 - "In him we live and move and have our being" (Epimenides)
  * Can't suppress the truth if you don't have the truth - all men have knowledge of God
    * After we fell, we did not cease to know God - we continue to know him - but we want to hold it down and suppress it
    * But in suppressing it, we have it
    * Takes the form of exchanging truth for a lie
    * Exchange takes the form of worshiping something created
    * We choose what we'll worship, but THAT we'll worship is a given
    * Hearts become idol factories
    * In suppressing truth, we deny what is patently obvious
      * Sin makes us experts in self deception
      * Sin makes us affirm and believe that which we know is not the case
      * Sin causes us to fight for those things that we know are false
      * Sin is not a state of ignorance - it is a state of denying what we know to be the case and affirming what we know is NOT the case
      * Those apart from Christ are spending their time denying reality
      * "I can't believe this person in my congregation is denying what they know is the case" - pastors
    * In our sin, we choose another master
      * A master rules, dictates
      * We obey
      * When you are ruled by something else, you can't get yourself out of that rule
      * This is why the world doesn't know what to do with addictions - people choose to be ruled by something else because they will not have God in their lives



* Doesn't condescension violate immutability?
