# Lecture 11 - God's Relationship to Creation

* Problem: There is a change from wrath to grace to God, yet God is immutable
* Start with Christology - incarnation of Jesus Christ
  * WCF8.2 - Son of God... took upon Him man's nature, with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin; two whole, perfect, and distinct natures, the Godhead and the manhood, were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion
    * Hypostatic union - union of two natures in one person
    * Without conversion - one isn't converted into the other
    * Without composition - each nature is not composed
    * Without confusion - "fuse with" - they didn't fuse into each other
    * How? Mystery - we don't know; church has always come up against intellectual limits
  * Remains the same person, even though he is the same person with a human nature (which he takes forever)
  * Turretin: Trinity helps us understand the Incarnation
  * Ridderbos: Christ is the Son of God in the supra- and prehistorical sense of the word, grounding biblical theology
    * Ontology (being of son of God as son of God) grounds the history
    * Christ is both the second Adam and the Pre-existent One in his divine glory
    * Phil 2 - image of God elucidates the eternal relationship of father and son
  * Phil 2:5-7 - Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
    * "form of God"
      * Silva - form of God = equal to God's nature; form of servant = status of Christ as incarnate
    * "made himself nothing"
      * Christ had a particular mindset, sees our plight, and stoops down to our level
      * emptied himself by becoming something he was not previously; empty himself = humble himself
      * Some want to say that Christ gave up aspects or attributes of his deity
      * Instead, he adds properties freely, contingently, that in no way undermines his basic divine character
  * Controversies
    * Nestorius (Nestorianism) - against Theotokos (that Mary could be called the mother of God)
      * Christ is one person, but not one hypostasis
      * So two hypostases; no hypostatic union
      * Christ must be two persons, or at least a double personality
    * Eutyches (Euthychianism)
      * One nature instead of two
    * Chalcedonian Creed (451 AD)
      * Acknowledges two natures inconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, and inseparably
      * The distinction of natures is by no means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature is preserved, and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not parted or divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ
  * Hypostatic Union
    * Personal union with respect to who Jesus is
    * No new person
    * The temporal presupposes the ontological
  * Christ's Human Nature
    * anhypostatic - the human nature was impersonal or non-self-existent
    * enhypostatic - literally, in-personality. Something having its subsistence in the person or personality of another
    * The personal is primary in the incarnation; the person of the Son takes on humanity
    * NOT two abstract human natures coming together to make a person
    * A person adding another nature
  * Communicatio idiomatum
    * Lutheran - communication of properties across natures
    * Reformed
      * Murray - communion of properties
      * Calvin - when the Lord of glory is said to be crucified, Paul does not mean that he suffered anything in his divinity
      * Turretin - an effect of the union by which the properties of both natures became common to the person
      * Any property can be ascribed to the person
    * So you can say rightly of the person anything that is ascribed to the person, even though it looks like at times we are being utterly contradictory
      * Christ has two wills, and they don't look like they're compatible, but they are - we just can't see how
  * Extra Calvinisticum
    * The error (according to lutherans): the person of the Son of God is not contained within the Person of God as the God-man, but rather the former transcends, in his deity, the latter. This is denied by the Lutherans, affirmed by the Reformed
    * There is, then, an 'outside' (extra) aspect....
    * Calvin
    * Helm - whatever is essential to the divine nature cannot be yielded up in the Incarnation... the Son of God is God and has God's essence... it must preserve the divinity of the Son of God unaltered
      * Son of God is who he is essentially and could not be otherwise
      * Humanity does not contain his deity
    * According to his humanity, Jesus does not know the day
    * According to his divinity, Jesus does know the day
    * Jesus in the Garden, desiring a different way, was according to his humanity
  * Barth is wrong as usual
  * Reduplicative Strategy
    * 'Qua' statements - "x qua A is N"
    * True? "Christ as Man is a creature"?
    * Christ as God is infinite and Christ as Man is not infinite.
      * Contradiction and unacceptable... to philosophers
      * Once we establish two natures, its not a problem
      * Aquinas didn't have enough categories to describe what was happening here
    * Can't go from the person of Christ to the natures, because Christ is both fully God and fully Man
  * Praedicatio verbalis - Verbal predication of properties from both natures of the One Person who is Christ
  * Owen - because it was of two substances or essences in the same person, in opposition unto all accidental union, as 'the fullness of the Godhead dwealt in him bodily'
    * Uses a different view of accident, based on substance metaphysic
  * What happens to person of Christ happens to God himself in history

* Christology to Theology Proper
  * Classification of Characteristics:
    * God, and God alone, is "eimi"
    * We, on the other hand, are comnpletely and exhaustively God's image; we are eikonic
  * Fundamental Distinction
    * The eimi/eikon distinction
    * The distinction of the "I Am" and his image
  * God's Character
    * Essential properties - eimi
    * Covenental properties - eikon
  * Question 1: Is there a pre-incarnate communicatio idiomatum with respect to God?
    * Exodus 32:14 - God relented
    * Mal 3:6 - God does not change
    * Genesis 3:8-9 - heard sound of Yahweh walking in the garden
      * Must have condescended, taken on characteristics, to have communication with Adam and Eve
  * Question 2: Is there a pre-Incarnate extra calvinisticum?
    * God cannot cease to be omnipotent, omniscient, etc...
  * Question 3: Is there a pre-incarnate reduplicative strategy? Yes, but...
    * Affirms that contradictory propositions can be legitimately applied to the same person
    * Not a crass contradiction because the person has taken on different natures or context wrt attributes
* Essential Governs Covenantal
  * God is essentially a se - everything he is, he is by virtue of who he is - he is in need of nothing
  * God's covenantal (contingent) properties are
    * anhypostatic - non-self-subsistent
    * enhypostatic - in-personality, having subsistence only in a person
  * There is assymetrical relation between the two

* Problem: There is a change from wrath to grace to God, yet God is immutable
  * How do we think about it? Same way we think about Christ walking the earth, being both in Galilee and omnipresent
  * Just because we ascribe one thing doesn't mean that we're denying the other thing
