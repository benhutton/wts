# Character of the Triune God

* WCF - There is but one only living and true God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passion, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute
* Westminster Catechism #7 - What is God? God is a Spirit, in and of himself infinite in being, glory, blessedness, and perfection; all-sufficient, eternal, unchangeable, incomprehensible, every where present, almighty, knowing all things, most wise, most holy, most just, most merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth
* Distinctions between attributes (useful, needful, but not comnprehensive)
  * Standard way of classifying is in terms of incommunicable and communicable attributes
    * Some aspects of character are in no way communicated to creation (no analogies available to us in creation)
    * Others can in some way (must be spelled out) be communicated to creation
      * Bavinck - even these are uncommunicable, because they are only analogically communicated, not univocally
  * Absolute and relative (used by John Owen)
    * Absolute = by virtue of who he is, relative to nothing
    * Relative = relative to creation
  * Archetypal/echtypal
    * Archetypal - by virtue of who he is
    * Echtypal - from who he is

# Oliphint's way of classifying

* Not historical, but maybe better
* Essential and covenantal characteristics
* Has a specifically apologetic point to it
* Drange's incompatible properties argument
  * See slide
  * "If the creation were accidental, then that in itself would imnply that God is imperfect... and that would be another basis for the Perfection-vs-Creation Argument"
* Relationship of God to creation really is where the tension with respect to God's character resides
  * How do we think about God relative to creation?
  * How are we to think about God's relationship to creation? In Biblical categories
* How to conclude for less-than-God
  * Take any of the essential attributes of God
  * Argue that God, because of the nature of creation, cannot have this attribute
  * Conclude that we must give up believing that God has this attribute
* Need to have categories of God's essential character and God's covenantal character
  * Designed to fill a gap that is significant to theology proper
* Bavinck - rightly trying to protect the biblical view of God's simplicity
  * How can something add to God's character? Would undermine God' simplicity and aseity.
  * "But in God there is actually no such thing as choice in as much as it always presupposes uncertainty, doubt, and deliberation"
    * Scripture cannot support this
    * Choice does not always presuppose uncertainty or doubt
    * "Let there be light"... "Let us make man in our image"
      * No choice? No deliberation?
      * Does God's immutability mean that he could not have chosen this?
  * "Every hint of arbitrariness, contingency, or uncertainty is alien to his will, which is eternally determinate and unchanging"
    * Is God's necessary willing of himself identical with his willing of creation?
    * Is every hint of contingency alien to God's will?
  * Is God creator before he created?
* Problem
  * We need to affirm God's aseity - God is self contained and doesn't need anything in order to be as he is.
  * God as perfect = he doesn't lack anything; self-comnplete
  * Real division between reformed and arminian = God's character, wrt creation
    * Have deficient history and order of salvation is doctrine of God is deficient
* Think about God's essential attributes
  * Essence - a property, or set of properties, which something has necessarily
  * What God necessarily is
  * Modal categories = how something exists in a particular way; a mode of existence
    * Possible worlds - tell us something about what we mean by necessity and impossibility
      * What might be
      * "Where are many ways things could have been besides the way they are"
      * "Ways things could have been" = possible worlds
        * Could be necessary, contingent, or impossible
      * = a maximal, possible, state of affairs
        * maximal = a full set of affairs
      * (note that the possible might include the actual, since what is actual is, ipso facto, possible)
      * There is a possible world close to the actual world in which this course meets on Friday
  * Essential = for anything x and any possible world, W, in which x exists and any property P, x has P in W
    * It is impossible for God not to have property x (say, infinity)
    * Essential means "impossible not to be"; absolutely necessary
* Contingent (covenantal) = for anything x and any possible world W, in which x exists and any property P, x has P in W and x does not have P in W1
  * Means P is contingent property, possible to have or not have
* God's essential character
  * R Muller: "The way in which God is what he is in the simplicity of the divine essence cannot be known by the human mind... we are given to know the divine attributes or essential properties by revelation and rational reflection on revelation in such a way that God's nature is truly known by means of the revealed attributes."
    * We cannot know God as he knows himself, but we can know his essential properties by his revelation
  * Muller on Calvin: "belongs as much to the theological tradition, with its interest in the divine essence and in its understanding of Scripture as containing references to the divine being, as any of the later Reformed writer."
    * Barthians posit that Calvin wasn't interested in divine characteristics; Muller says Calvin would have assumed that
  * Name of God relating to God's essence
    * "I am who I am" = self-complete, self-referential
    * Possible to pour too much into this, but the opposite is the case in our context
  * Much of what we say about God comes from good and necessary consequence
  * Perfect being - doesn't lack anything
  * Possibility and necessity
    * God's existence is possibly exemplified
    * Means that there is a possible world in which God exists
    * God has p in every world
    * extends not only to his existence but to anything else that God has (or is) essentially. P is thus necessary
  * God is essentially infinite and eternal, by virtue of his character
    * God is revealed as being self-constrained - the only thing that constrains God is God
  * "Names of God... provided the natural point of contact between the biblical language of God and a more strictly philosophical discussion." - Muller
* God's covenantal character
  * Calvin: everything we have by revelation is accomodation
    * Not accomodating to cultures, but accomodating to our finiteness
    * Gen 3:8, Gen 22, Ex 3, Judg 2, Ps 34:7, Is 37:36
    * Nothing that God does makes us conclude that God must be only temporal, only finite
    * Rather, we conclude that God condescends
    * Relational accomodation
  * Paul Helm - There is no change in God, he loves us from eternity. There is however a change in us, a change that occurs as by faith Christ's work is appropriated. The change is not from wrath to grace but from our belief that we are under wrath to our belief that we are under grace.
    * Tries to reconcile God's essential character with activity in the world
    * Problems: 
      * Moves from objective to subjective
      * Says that scripture tells us to believe something that is not true
    * God is essentially immutable
      * Then God chooses to create, in this choice is a plan (including redemption)
      * God chooses to relate to creation and take on attributes and properties that he didn't have to have, one of which is his wrath
      * God can move from wrath to grace without change to essential characteristics
      * In incarnation, takes on human characteristics. So why not others?
  * God as creator
    * Is God creator in all possible worlds? Did God have to create?
    * This is a contingent characteristic
    * Takes place by virtue of God's free decision
    * Once God decides, it becomes necessary
