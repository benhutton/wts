  * Necessity + contingency
  * Not too concerned with details of thomistic and barthian arguments, but need to know why they are part of the problem

# What God Does

* God's Decrees
  * We discuss them b/c they are given to us in the Bible - not inventing ideas/topics to discuss
    * Need to be careful to pay attention to how to best biblically think about them
  * "When the Lord closes his holy lips, (man) shall at once close the way to inquiry." - Calvin
    * At the point of mystery - can articulate some things; others will transcend understanding
    * May be questions we want to ask that God has not seen fit to answer - best not to ask those questions
  * "And let us not be ashamed to submit our understanding to God's boundless wisdom so far as to yield before its many secrets. For of those things which it is neither given nor lawful to know, ignorance is learned; the craving to know, a kind of madness." - Calvin
    * We have all that we need
    * Wiser not to know, confessing that the secret things belong to God
* Need understanding of knowledge and will of God
  * WCF 3:1-2 - "God, from all eternity, did, by the most wise and holy counsel of His own will freely, and unchangeably ordain whatsoever comes to pass."
    * "Yet so, as thereby neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures; nor is the liberty or contingency of second causes taken away, but rather established."
  * WCF 3:2 - "Althought God knows whatsoever may or can come to pass upon all supposed conditions, yet hath He not decreed anything because He foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such conditions."
    * Rejection of middle knowledge
    * God knows all that will come to pass, but does NOT decree because of this foreseeing
    * Sets out character of God's knowledge before introducing the decrees themselves
  * "Humbled and cast down, we may learn to tremble at his judgment and esteem his mercy." - Calvin
  * "Let this be our conclusion: to tremble with Paul at so deep a mystery." - Calvin
  * "They who measure divine justice by the standard of human justice are acting perversely." - Calvin quoting Augustine
  * The Knowledge of God
    * Need to start with God - not man or creation
      * God does NOT just know more than us - he knows differently from us
      * God's knowledge is equivalent to his being - he doesn't add knowledge to his being
      * What he knows he knows exhaustively; there is nothing that he does not know
      * God is one who essentially knows all things, and this knowledge was not learned or given by way of process
      * "God thinks what he is and is what he thinks" - Van Til
    * scientia necessaria - Necessary Knowledge
      * Object is those things that are necessary, namely God himself
    * scientia libera - Free Knowledge
      * Has foundation in God's free will
      * Those things that he determined to do, but does not have to do
      * By doing these things freely, they are ad extra (outside of God), and so contingent
      * God knows creation because he willed to create and knows that which he created exhaustively
      * Has to do with what God determined and then what he did wrt that determination
    * We don't separate them, but make a distinction, because there are things existing now that didn't have to exist
    * God knows everything because he is God, not because of the things that are. They are what they are b/c of God's knowledge and will
    * God's knowledge is simple - not composed of parts
    * Exhaustively knowing b/c he is exhaustively self-complete
  * The difficulty, historically
    * There are contingent things that are known by God, that are part of God's free knowledge (because these things are what they are b/c of God's free will)
    * Conundrum: God has relationship with contingents, not keeping himself aloof
    * Some say: that which he freely knows cannot coincide w/ himself b/c he is necessary
    * Need to think about relation of contingent to necessity (creation to creator)
    * In making distinctions, does NOT make God contingent, or that God knows by way of propositions and learning subjects and predicates
    * God is not in the process of ferreting out true vs false propositions
    * We make distinction between necessary and free knowledge to affirm distinction between necessary and contingent objects
    * Included in God's necessary knowledge is knowledge of all possibilities that obtain? (Because of God's power)
      * Not the best way to think about it - best to locate the possibilities in the domain of God's free knowledge, because the very object is ad extra
      * It is possible that God might not create, or create differently
      * What is possible when there is nothing but God? Impossible to delineate this
        * Our possibility is attached to what is
      * Better to put possibility in free will and free knowledge of God
  * The Free Knowledge of God
    * Free knowledge and will of God have their focus in what God determines
      * Knowledge direct, will enjoins, power executes - Turretin
      * When discussing God's free will, therefore, what he freely knowls just is what he freely wills
    * The free will of God is tied to his eternal decree
      * Free will does not simply coincide with activity of creation, but is eternal
      * Free determination is an activity of the Triune God, even before the foundation of the world
      * Decree is not temporally based, but is from eternity
    * Scientia media - Middle knowledge
      * Falls between necessary and free
      * Molina wrote "A harmony of free will with the gift of grace, divine foreknowledge, providence, predestination, and reprobation"
        * Wants to affirm God's sovereignty and man's freedom
        * The ability to choose or not choose in any situation, called nowadays "libertarian freedom"
        * Cannot admit of any ordaining power wrt this choice
        * Wants to reject the idea that God ordains whatsoever comes to pass upon no conditions
        * Wants to say that God ordains whatsoever comes to pass based on our decisions
        * Trying to clarify Thomas Aquinas
      * Two dogmas of Thomism and Molinism
        * The freedom of will has not been destroyed by original sin
        * That freedom of will remains unimpaired under the influence of Divine grace
      * Molina was trying to fix up Aquinas' system
      * How do grace and free will relate to each other?
        * Free will is an intuitive assumption - "We all just know this"
          * Don't use scripture to build their case
          * Scripture is meant to shatter intuition
          * Thus John Owen called it an idol
        * Debate between Dominicans and Jesuits
          * Dominicans - physical premotion = God applies our faculties to the acceptance of grace
            * We make choice, God helps out
          * Jesuits - Molinism = scientia media
        * Catholics discussed this for 20 years, decided that it couldn't be resolved, but the Molinist view became the prominent view
          * Predominant view of Christianity in the West
      * Two aspects of God's knowledge and his will in middle knowledge
        * It posits, with respect to the free knowledge of God, a discontinuity (rather than, as we noted above, a coincidence) between God's knowledge of what we be, on the one hand, and his determination of what will be, on the other
        * The foundation, ground or principium on which middle knowledge depends is hte libertarian free will of the creature
      * Has to do with knowledge of possibilities - counterfactuals
        * WCF 3:2 - Although God knows whatsoever may or cna come to pass upon all supposed conditions, yet hath He not decreed anything because He foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such conditions.
        * God looks down the corridors of time, sees what you would do in any situation, and bases decrees on that
        * Constraint on the character of God
        * They want to keep saying "sovereignty", so they make "sovereignty" into "nonsovereignty" and keep saying "sovereignty"
        * Middle knowledge is prior to the divine will, its content is independent of hte divine will, and hence, outside the pale of God's omnipotence. Just as God's knowledge of logical truths is outside his control and is simnply given, so, too, his knowledge of what would be the free decision of created wills under certain circumstances is simnply given and outside his control - William Lane Craig
          * Have things like logical truths outside of God
          * When there was nothing but God, what are those logical truths? Are those truths as necessary as God's being?
          * Necessity of logical truths depends on God's creative activity
          * Point is that God knows what will occur contingently on certain conditions lying outside of his will
            * There can be no scientia media because there can be no being independent of the divine will
            * What kind of thing is it that can exist quite apart from God's determining that it will exist?"
              * The falsity of a notion of middle knowledge and the inability to sustain such a distinction appears, according to Twisse, when it is asked, not how such a contingent can be known, but rather how 'such a contingent shall exist'"
              * Counterfactuals are dependent on factuals, about which a decision has already been made... can't pretend that nothing is something
