* Yahweh
  * Keil and Delitzsch
    * The repetition of the verb in the same form, and connected only by the relative, signifies that the being or act of the subject expressed in the verb is determined only by the subject itself."
  * Exodus 3:1-14
    * Beginning of the Exodus; God sets Moses aside as mediator to accomplish it
    * Angel of Yahweh is spoken of as God
    * Moses is in the Lord's presence
      * Nothing is special about a room in a church building except when the Lord has condescended to meet with you there
    * God announces who he is in terms of covenant - God of patriarchs
    * Full intensity of God's character is turned to the suffering of his people in Egypt
      * Idiom: "Seeing I have seen"
    * Knowledge of suffering is intimate
    * Announcing that he's about to do something through Moses as mediator
    * Moses suspects that God hasn't thought through this very carefully
      * "Who am I?" - maybe trying to be humble?
    * God basically tells Moses "wrong question"
      * What matters is who God is - not who Moses is
      * NOT appealing to Moses' qualifications
    * Tells Moses "I will be with you"
      * Presence of the Lord will distinguish from every other nation
      * God's presence makes the difference
    * Moses asks "what if" question - "what if they ask what your name is"
      * Why should Israel trust Moses, that he will do what he's said?
    * God reveals his name YHWH - "I am"
      * God is utterly self sufficient
        * Did not depend on whims of Pharoah or weaknesses of Moses to accomplish the task
      * Covenant name - able to carry out whatever task he determines to do
      * Describes aseity - that God is of himself (and is the only one who could be)
        * Self-complete, not in need of anything
        * We exist because God determined we would exist
        * God exists in himself - no contingency
      * Commentaries argue that Israel would not have understood this in a metaphysical way because they weren't thinking like Greek philosophers
        * Foolish, because Israel can know ultimate realities without metaphysical terminology
        * It is possible to pour too much into the name, but this isn't the problem we have today
      * God as self-complete entails the incommunicable attributes that we ascribe to God
        * Infinity => If God is not dependent, he's not constrained by space
          * Negative/apophatic term - "not finite"
          * God's existence is not determined by a place
          * Where was God before creation? Bad question - there was no "where", there was only God.
    * "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
    * YHWH does not mean "Lord over" anything - translating as "LORD" misconstrues it a little
    * Revelation transcends accomodation
      * We can now say that God is who he is and affirm certain things about God
      * God isn't depended on accomodation to be who he is
    * Vos: God gives show and tell of revelation in epochal moments of revelation
      * Jesus feeding the 5000 - not meant to be like Oprah (everybody gets a prize), but meant to show that Jesus is the bread of heaven
      * Miracles are not there for the "wow" factor - they're there to tell us who God is and what he's up to
      * Burning bush is because God is the covenant God, with his people, and is who he is
        * Fire that is self generated, providing its own fuel; not dependent on the fuel of the bush in order to burn
        * And yet, as what it is, it is in the bush, with the bush
    * God establishes his relationship with his people, even while he is utterly independent
      * Needs Moses because he has chosen to use Moses, but he will accomplish it regardless
    * God determines what he wants to do, that's what will happen, and he always determines to do the right thing, even if we don't see it that way
      * Doesn't need us in any way to be who he is or accomplish his purposes
  * Exodus 6:2-6
    * YHWH connected with what God will do in redemption
  * Exodus 33:18-20
    * God's glory will pass before Moses in the sense that he will proclaim his name
  * Exodus 34:5-7
    * Puts Moses in cleft of rock
    * Passes by and says his name twice
    * Explains who he is as covenant God - faithful to covenant
    * So that we will recognize that covenant is not dependent on us in any way
    * God is the intiator of the entire of our salvation
  * Self-existent one who has determined to redeemed - Calvin
  * Psalm 50
    * Judgment Psalm against Israel
    * Start with "The Mighty One, God, Yahweh" because they forgot that
    * God is coming and condescending to judge his poeple
    * "I am God, your God" - alludes to 10 commandments, reminds them that he has delivered them from slavery, according to his own character
      * First thing you have to know, before the commandments, is that God has redeemed and broken the bond of slavery
      * 10 commandments are the things about which you acknowledge your salvation - NOT the things you're about to be saved from
    * Problem in Israel is the same problem we have - Israel looked at the cultures surrounding it and their quid pro quo sacrifices and convinced itself that its sacrifices were needed by God and doing him a favor
      * Exactly what much of the church thinks today: God needs us. We do our part and God does his part.
    * "To the wicked" - the leaders of Israel
      * Bible is irrelevant and fundamentally neglected
    * "You thought that I was one like yourself"
      * "You thought the I Am was like you"
      * Bad: Because of who I am, God cannot be X
      * Instead: Because of who God is, I must be X
      * Struggle through the Christian life: need to continually remind ourselves that God is not like us
      * Just because God has condescended doesn't mean that he is one of us
      * Never ceased to be fully God
      * Open theism is wicked because it takes away the glory of the I Am and transfers it to human beings
  * Exodus 33:13-14
  * Isaiah 63:9-14
    * Isaiah explaining the exodus
    * "So you led your people, to make for yourself a glorious name."
      * God is doing what he's doing now for his own glory - not for our glory or comfort
    * "In all their affliction, he was afflicted"
      * This is how he knew their suffering
      * In God's deliverance of his people from their slavery, he was afflicted
      * Take you to the cross
      * This is why Exodus is so important for understanding the NT
  * "I am that I am being with his people"
    * Ought to lead to who Christ is - "Before Abraham was, I Am"
    * Jesus is Yahweh in the flesh
    * Unburning bush is a picture of Jesus
      * He is the "I am" while being God incarnate, with us
    * Second person of the trinity is not "Jesus" until he is incarnate
      * OT doesn't have "christophanies" but "uios-ophanies" - seeing the Son, not the Messiah
  * God does not have the option to not be God
    * God cannot deny himself
      * No just "will not" but "cannot"
    * God's will is constrained by his nature
    * Jesus did not have the power to decide, "I'm not going to be God any more; I'm going to be man"
    * Jesus was fully God, yet took on attributes/characteristics
    * If you deny that Jesus is fully God, that is heresy
      * Machen in "Christianity vs. Liberalism" - Liberalism is not Christianity
  * Notion of free will is a false God, an idol that needs to be destroyed
    * If free will = power of contrary choice
    * Not even God has this - does not have the power to choose to not be God
    * The will is constrained by the nature
    * Adam and Eve - power to choose good or evil because nature had power to choose
    * After sin, no power to choose for God unless God calls us forth from the grave
    * As Christians - power to choose good or evil because nature is different because of regeneration
