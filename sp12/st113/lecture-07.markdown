# God's Triunity

* Teach Triunity first, then attributes for pedagogical reasons
* God is one God in three persons, Father, Son, and HS, and each person is fully and completely God
* Need both Biblical and Systematic Theology
  * Term "Trinity" is not in the Bible but concept is there
  * Without ST, there's no orthodoxy
* John Owen
  * We begin with mystery - God is incomprehensible
  * God is known because he reveals himself
  * You either embrace doctrine of Trinity and worship God or you reject it and get angry about it because your mind can't comprehend it
  * "Of course you can't understand it - we're talking about God here."
    * We don't have laws of thinking that can make sense of this
    * Unity and diversity are equally ultimate in the ontological Trinity - Van Til
    * Not contained in the context and laws of creation itself
  * Essentials of Christianity (Trinity, incarnation, resurrection, new birth, etc.) are like this
* WCF 6.1 - "by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture"
* God reveals more and more throughout history. Is Trinity in OT? Early church appealed to a few things:
  * Elohim is plural name - thus a plurality in the divine being
  * Genesis 1:26 - "Let us make man..." indicates some kind of plurality
  * Genesis 18 - 3 visitors to Abraham
  * Several manifestations of the "Angel of the Lord" - distinction and identity
  * None of these point to Triunity in any specific way
  * God is always to be known and worshiped according to revelation given at a particular period
  * Warfield - "The OT may be likened to a chamber richly furnished but dimly lighted... The myster of the trinity is not revealed in the OT... thought it is extended and enlarged."
  * Was clear that God is one, yet did not create out of a need for fellowship
* More explicit in NT
  * Matthew 3:16-17 - Jesus baptized, Spirit descends like dove, Father says he is well pleased
    * Clear that we DON'T have 3 modes of appearance
    * Have 3 distinct hypostases/persons
* Calvin - as soon as we think of the 3, we think of the 1, and as soon as we think of the 1, we think of the 3
* Most explicit expression in the incarnation of the Son
  * Mission is to make the Father known, do the Father's will
  * Tension in the face of OT monotheism
  * Deity of Christ
    * Warfield: The very abundance and persuasiveness of the deity of Christ greatly increases the difficulty of adequately stating it.
      * Presupposed on every page of scripture
    * John 1:1-3
      * Expect, "in the beginning, God". Now, "in the beginning was the Word"
      * Is God AND with God (distinct) at the same time
      * Affirmation that logos is God
      * JW think it should be "a God"
        * A technical reason - anarthrous nouns are frequently definite in character and context helps determine if it should be definite
          * John 1:49 - "You are the king of Israel" - "king" is anarthrous but context demands definiteness
          * Hebrews 1:1-2 - "Spoken to us by his Son" - "Son" is anarthrous
        * A contextual reason
          * John 1:18 - "No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father's side, he has made him known."
          * Excludes the Logos from principles of createdness
          * "Word became flesh + dwelt among us is a fulfillment" of redemptive historical theme
        * An evangelistic reason
          * Only a position that ascribes full deity to Christ makes sense of the whole Gospel
          * John 20:30-31 - "These are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name"
          * Thomas' confession: "my Lord and my God" - logos = kurios = yahweh
        * A theological reason
          * Ego eimi principle
          * John 18:4-6 - "Jesus said to him, 'I am'"
      * "Jesus is Lord" = "Jesus is Yahweh"
    * Synoptics
      * A mutual knowledge and intimacy with God
      * Matthew 11:27 - no one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him
        * Claim to absolute communion in the divine being
        * Predicating revelation of Father and Son on intimate knowledge each has of the other
        * Have knowledge by virtue of own character, not derivatively. WE have knowledge derivatively
        * Covenant of redemption/pactum saludis
        * Ontology grounds history - history has its ground in the ontology of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God as God, who in his own secret council determines what he will do, why he will do it, and how he will do it.
      * Mark 1:1-3, 2:1-5
        * Jesus is Yahweh
        * People who know OT should see Jesus as who he really is
        * Promised Messiah is God
        * Miracles are show and tell - prove he can do invisible things that only God can do (forgive sins) by doing visible things that only God can do (heal paralytics)
      * Psalm 107:28-30 + Mark 4:35-41
        * Calming the storm: "Who is this, that even wind and sea obey him?"
        * Answer in Psalm 107: "They cried out to Yahweh... he made the storm be still"
      * Matthew 28:18-20 - Universal Lordship/Universal Presence
        * Better to have Spirit indwell - universal presence
        * Imagine anyone saying this but God - "all authority on heaven and earth"
        * Deuteronomy 31:7-8 = Yahweh will never leave you nor forsake you
        * Warfield: "The alternatives constantly stare us in the face: either He is God or He is not sane. Either He is God or He is not good... He makes or mars the world."
    * Pauline Testimony
      * Romans 9:5 - "To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen."
      * Titus 2:11-13 - "Waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ."
      * The way in which Paul so consistently describe Jesus as kurios (kurios in LXX is used for yahweh)
        * Confessing "Jesus is Lord" is NOT confessing Jesus is your Lord, but confessing that Jesus is Yahweh
      * Paul makes ascriptions to Jesus the way OT does to Yahweh
        * Isaiah 8:13-14 and Romans 9:32-33 - stone of stumbling and rock of offence
        * Isaiah 43:20-25 and Romans 14:10-12/Phil 2:9-11 - every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God/that Jesus is Lord
          * Jesus takes to himself the name and the prerogatives of Yahweh
          * Not the name "Jesus" that causes everyone to bow and confess, but the name "Yahweh" (Jesus who is Yahweh)
      * Paul ascribes activities to Jesus that were ascribed to Yahweh in OT
        * Great statements of God alone being savior
        * Creation as a divine work
        * Element of worship: to him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
        * Prayer is offered directly to Jesus
        * God as judge/Jesus is judge


Duality?
Why not more?
Yahweh = God as Trinity or God as Son?
