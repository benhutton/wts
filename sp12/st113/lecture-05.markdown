# Revelation in Jesus Christ

* Creation is the theater of revelation (Kuyper?)
  * Theater is good word - we are spectators
  * God who made us shows himself to all creation in all creation
* Revelation takes place in history; history is revelational and revelation is historical
  * Revelation is given progressively, not all at once
  * Revelation is a noun of action - not a once for all completed act (Vos)
  * Covenant history; redemptive history
  * "The line of revelation is like the step of those trees that grow in rings. Each successive ring has grown out of the preceding ones." (Vos)
    * Continuity and progress
    * God's people are responsible to know and worship God according to what he has revealed
  * Hebrews 1:1-2 - "In these last days he has spoken to us by his Son"
    * This is the completion of revelation - no need for anything more
  * 1 John 3:2 - "When he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is."
    * Revelation continues again at the coming of Christ
    * Walking by sight
    * See him as he is, glorious; days as suffering servant are over
  * 1 Cor 13:12 - "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known."
    * Between 1st and 2nd coming, there is no more revelation coming or needed
    * Wants to highlight the quality of our knowledge
  * Revelation 21:22-25 - "The glory of God gives itlight, and its lamp is the Lamb."
    * The glory of God and the lamb illumine all of creation
    * Psalm 36:9 - "For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light."
    * Eternal dynamic relationship with God, knowing God better and better and more and more for eternity
    * We can increase in knowledge of God for eternity and never plumb the depths of who he is
    * Knowledge is always creaturely, finite, dependent on God to reveal himself
      * Yet inexhaustible because God can keep revealing himself
      * Eternal life "is knowledge of God" - our knowledge of God grows more and more


# Who God Is - The Name Of God

* Matthew 28:18-20 (Great Commission)
  * Baptism = mark placed on you to say that you are publically set apart by work God has done
  * "In the name" - name given in baptism is not "Jesus Christ" but "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"
    * "Name" is singular, not plural
    * Name is the name that God has now that Christ has come
    * All names have redemptive historical place
    * Climactic name of God is Father, Son, Holy Spirit
* Names have significant redemptive historical connotations
  * God changes the names of people according to certain redemptive activities and qualifications
    * Abram => Abraham
    * Saul => Paul
* Four stages
  * Patriarchs
    * Known as creator and the God of those patriarchs
    * Expressing power as creator and relationship to those whom he has chosen
    * "Creator" - brought about everything there is
    * "God of" - hasn't left things the way they are but relates to his creation. He is "our God", we are "his people"
    * God is creator and redeemer of a people that he has chosen
  * Revelation of name to Moses at the burning bush
    * YHWH isn't particularly a new name
    * The point of the exodus is the focal point of the OT
    * Exodus is picture of redemption
    * Initiation warrants God giving revelation and interpretation of name as "I Am" - Yahweh
    * God tells us inner significance of divine name
    * Jesus: "I've manifested your character to those who you gave to me"
      * Jesus is the manifestation of the name of God
      * Name has something to do with redemption that God accomplishes
      * Christ is on the earth to save his people
    * Process of redemption has impetus in the name of God revealed/manifested in Christ himself
    * Apex of Jesus' revelation of himself = "I am"
      * Throughout the Gospel of John - all the "I am" statements
  * Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
    * When Son is revealed as Son, the obvious entailment is that there is a Father
    * "Our Father" has its focus in the Son
    * Better that Jesus goes away because he will send the HS
* Bavinck
  * Proper names (nomina propria)
  * Essential names or attributes (nomina essentialia)
  * Personal names (Father, Son, HS) (nomina personalia)
  * Sermon series idea: names of God in redemptive history
* Jesus has a name written on him that only he knows - incomprehensible
* Name is protected by the 10 Commandments
  * Even the utterance of it in a way that is inappropriate is sin
* Our responsibility as Christians is to name God as he has named himself - can't give him new names
  * What we say about God is a reflection of what God has said about himself
  * To change the name of God is to address another God
* Name of God as "Yahweh" is used over 5000 times in the OT
  * God picks it out, interprets it, uses it a ton -> shows us the central significance of the name
  * Genesis 2:4 - 3:24 - use of the double name "Elohim Yahweh"
    * Gives prominence to the fact that Yahweh is Elohim
    * The God who visits man is the same God who created the world
  * Imperfect of the verb hayah - heh yod heh
  * Likely pronounce "Yahweh" or something like it
  * Vulgate: ego sum qui sum = "I am who I am"
  * Keil and Delitzsch: "The repetition of the verb in the same form, and connected only by the relative, signifies that the being or act of the subject expressed in the verb is determined only by the subject itself"
  * Luther: "I will be what I will be" - allowable but kinda of obscuring what Moses' point is
  * God is his being and character
  * We are what we have been and are becoming - we are dependent and contingent
  * The referent for God's being is God alone - God himself
  * "I am my own being and there is nothing outside of me that makes me who I am"
    * God and God alone is absolute (not relative)
    * Everything else is relative
  * God is not defined by anything outside of himself
  * Absolute of idealism is not the Absolute God of Christianity because the Absolute of idealism is defined by something outside of itself - that which is relative (Van Til's PhD Thesis)
  * In terms of his essential character, God is self defined and self existent
    * Thus logic cannot be absolute and external
    * Before there was creation, it wasn't the case that there was God and nothing else - there was only God. No negative to define God's positive
  * Yahweh is essential, proper, personal name
