# Filioque Controversy

* "And from the son"
* Does the Holy Spirit proceed from the Father alone, or equally from the Father and from the Son?
  * Eastern Church: Father alone
  * Western Church: Father and the Son
* Why would this split the church?
  * Church was extremely concerned with what Scripture taught, and knowing God rightly
  * Gregory of Nyssa - It is not possible to exchange money or to go out to buy bread... without someone bringing up the problem of whether or not we can speak of the issue of procession of the Spirit.
  * Primary concern of Eastern Church was that the filioque clause would render a kind of di-theism (tendency was to emphasize the diversity; West emphasized the unity)
* Church split in 1054
  * Political situation was tentative
  * East was worried about vows of celibacy and papal authority
* Warfield: There is one only and true God, but in the unity of the Godhead there are three coeternal and coequal Persons, the same in substance but distince in subsistance.

# How do we distinguish the 3 without moving towards tri-theism?

* Aquinas - seeming contradiction appears when you say God is one and simple... then can't affirm that there are 3 and the 3 are really distinct
  * Distinctions in trinity are according to relations that each person has to the other - a relational distinction
  * Father begets, Son is begotten, Spirit proceeds
* Christopher Hughes - "On A Complex Theory Of A Simple God"
  * Gets Aquinas wrong in significant places and ways
  * Bringing together simplicity and trinity
  * Argues that Aquinas has to give up his doctrine of simplicity
  * The argument
    * Thomas makes a distinction between real relations and conceptual relations (which would lead to modalism)
    1.) The essence of an individual is in every case either a proper part of that individual or identical to that individual
      * In God, essence is identical with existence
    2.) Neither God nor any divine person is composite
      * Thomas would agree here
    3.) The essence of God is identical to God
      * God is not someone who takes to himself essential characteristics
    4.) The essence of each divine person is identical to that person
      * "The essence of Father is God"
    5.) The essence of God is identical to the essence of each diving person
      * Avoids Arianism, affirms homoousias
    6.) Any two divine persons are identical, which is the Sabellian heresy.
  * Hughes believes the only way out is to jettison the doctrine of simplicity
  * "In order to affirm Thomas' view we must deny an evident logical truth about identity."
    * transitivity of identity - 'whatever things are the same as one and the same thing, are the same as each other'
  * Though trinity is a mystery, we still can't affirm a crass contradiction. Problem with Aquinas is that he's relying on natural revelation
  * We may need to give up the law of identity. Law of noncontradiction presupposes the law of identity
    * Law of identity is not universally applicable

# Calvin

* "Let them yield themselves to be ruled by the heavenly oracles, even though they may fail to capture the height of the mystery."
* Nicene Creed "God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God"
* How does the "theos ek theou" relate to the Son as the second Person of the Trinity?
  * Relates to the nature of the Son's deity, his eternal Sonship, and his eternal generation
  * Shaff: Calvin would not sign Athanasian Creed because of its "damnable clauses"
  * Warfield: Calvin was concerned not to show allegiance to anything but Scripture, and did not have issues with the creeds (but wanted to clarify)
    * Shaff is grossly overstating things
* Pierre Caroli - "Calvin is Sabellian"
  * Calvin defended himself, got Caroli banished
* Valentine Gentilis
  * Determined that nothing can be true that did not conform to human reason
  * Essentiation = three Gods, three eternal, omnipotent, and infinite Beings
    * Propagation of essences, three in number
* Calvin set out to clarify how the essence of the godhead relates to the persons
  * Calvin advances the discussion; "equalizes"
* Was insistent that Christ is autoousia, or a se
  * Christ's deity is from himself
  * His deity, like that of the other Persons of the Trinity, was from Himself, and not from the Father
  * In respect to order and degree the beginning of divinity is in the Father, yet we say that it is a detestable invention that essence is proper to the Father alone, as if he were the deifier of the Son
  * God is one in essence, meaning that it cannot be derived and is not given (by Father to Son/HS)
  * Son with respect to his person is derived, but not with respect to his deity
* So Christ is both autoousia and theos ek theou
  * The Son is God without principium
  * The Son as person with principium in the Father


# Turretin

* The Son is God from himself although not the Son from himself
* Yet there is a communication of essence from the Father?
  * Doesn't fit together

# Hodge

* Father and Son are relative... relation is filiation or sonship
* Bible and creeds don't explain what this eternal begottenness means
* Only Begotten
  * monogenes - from ginomai or gennao?
  * Psalm 2:7 - "You are my Son; today I have begotten you" - eternal begottenness or a redemptive begottenness?
* Eternal begottenness = eternal sonship

# Van Til

* Says in one place that "God is one person and three persons"
  * It is sometimes asserted that we can prove to men that we are not asserting anything that they ought to consider irrational, inasmuch as we can say that God is one in essence and three in person. We therefore claim that we have not asserted unity and trinity of exactly the same thing.
  * We do assert that God (the whole Godhead) is one person
  * We need both the absolute cotermineity of each attribute and each person with the whole being of God
  * God is not an essence that has personality - he is absolute personality
  * Can't think of the one-ness as an abstraction, as a set of characteristics
  * God is personal, and not just because he is three persons. He is personal with respect to his one-ness (otherwise there would not be a cotermineity of the one and the three)
  * "One is person" uses person in a different way
* Hodge: God as God, everywhere in Scripture and by all Christians, is addressed as a person. We pray to each person separately, and to God as God
* Van Til is taking from Bavinck and Hodge on how we understand oneness
