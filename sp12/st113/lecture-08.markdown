# Trinity in Paul

# Holy Spirit

* We understand who he is progressively in revelation
* No problem thinking more specifically about Father and Son as persons in the Trinity
* Difficulty thinking of HS as person -> often addressed as "it"
* OT
  * Looks to be a power of Yahweh, sent for a particular purpose
    * Judges 3:10 - "Spirit of Yahweh was upon him, and he judged Israel"
    * Judges 14:6 - "Then the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon him"
  * Power clothing
    * Judges 6:34 - "But the Spirit of Yahweh clothed Gideon"
    * 1 Chronicles 12:18
    * 2 Chronicles 24:20
  * Personal aspects
    * Isaiah 63:9-10 - "They rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit"
    * Ephesians 4:30 - "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God"
  * Spirit sent by Yahweh, connected with the Word
    * 2 Samuel 23:2 - prophets are mouthpieces of the HS
    * Nehemiah 9:20 - "You gave your good spirit to instruct them"
    * God working with people through prophets, and HS giving the prophets his word
* NT
  * John 7:37-39 - "Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'" Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive, for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
    * "Spirit had not been given" is better rendered "Spirit was not"
    * Spirit reaches his ministry at glorification of Christ and at Pentecost
    * Not saying there was no Spirit, but he "was not" in terms of the climax of his ministry
    * Work of Christ glorified, baptising his people in and with the HS at the inauguration of the new covenant
    * Acts 2: Spirit is a missionary spirit, applying the redemption accomplished in the Son throughout the world to the ends of the earth
  * Spirit will be the presence of Christ (John 14:16, etc.)
    * Spirit is the paraclete - one called alongside
  * Matt 28:18-20 - "I am with you always" = HS
    * If HS indwells us Christ indwells us (same as "if you've seen me, you've seen the Father")
  * Christ is concerned to teach disciples about the doctrine of the Trinity at the very end of his ministry
    * HS's ministry and mission is to glorify Christ
    * "Spotlight ministry" (Packer)
      * Possible to be overly preoccupied with the ministry of the HS
  * Spirit is resisted (Acts 7)
  * Spirit is lied to (Ananias and Saphira)
  * Distinct person ("In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit")
  * Romans 8:26 - Spirit intercedes with groanings too deep for words, according to the will of God
    * Listen to Dr. Gaffin's sermon on this passage
  * 1 Cor 2:10-11 - "These things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God."
    * One who can understand the depths of God except God
  * Matthew 11:27
  * 2 Cor 13:14 - triadic terms

# Trinitarian Terminology

* Polycarp - (companion of John) - "I glorify You, through the Eternal high Priest, Jesus Christ, Your beloved Son, through whom be glory to You, with Him in the Holy Spirit, both now and forevermore."
  * 3 mentioned, through and with one another
  * Importance of this related directly to the worship of these Christians
    * Need to have in mind who it is you're worshiping
    * Cannot have true piety without true doctine
  * Urge early on to recognize both Christ and the HS in their worship
* Justin Martyr - We worship the Framer of this Universe, and Jesus Christ, our Teacher in these things, having learned that He is the Son of the true God, having Him in the second place, and the Prophetic Spirit in the third rank
  * Despite subordinationism here, there is "worshiping" of Father/Son/HS
* Athenagoras (second half of the second century) - Who would not be astonished to hear us called atheists, speaking as we do of the Father as God, and the Son as God, and the Holy Spirit, showing both their power in unity, and their distinction in order?
* Irenaeus (120-302) - Clear that Son and Spirit are divine
* Tertullian
  * Against Praxius- "sought refuge in the monarchy"
  * "We believe in one only God, yet subject to this dispensation, which is our word for economy, that the one only God has also a Son, His Word, ...which Son then sent, according to His promise, the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, out of the Father"
  * The mystery of the economy, which distributes the unity into Trinity, setting forth Father, Son, and Spirit as three"
  * One in substance
* Arius
  * Elder in the Eastern church 
  * Adamant about the unity of God
  * Second person originates from God and was created
    * Created out of nothing, yet a creature and something made
    * Quoted LXX version of Proverb 8:22 - "He created me in the beginning of his ways" (talking about wisdom)
    * ktidzo transalates hebrew kanah, which can mean create or can me acquire/possess
  * Christ was wholly unique, but unique in God's creation
  * Christ was a god
  * Jehovah's Witnesses are close to Arians
  * Arius' views were the predominant views
* Constantine called Council of Nicea in 325
  * Not the case that everyone was duped, but "most on the streets" were thinking in an Arian way. Still a lot of discontent remained.
  * "We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible; andin one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten of his Father, of the substance of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father."
  * A person was a Christian based on membership in church; church was to include the orthdox and exclude the heretical
    * Creed anathematizes Arians - excommunicates them
  * homoousion - identical essence
    * Not similar, but identical = "of the substance"
    * Term was intended to set forth the full deity of the Son
      * From the essence of the Father
  * Terminology wasn't as important as saying "Christ was fully God"
* Calvin: For who even of slight intelligence does not understand that, as nurses commonly do with infants, God is wont in a measure to "lisp" in speaking to us? Thus such forms of speaking do not....
* Calvin: Now, although the heretics rail at the word "person" or certain squeemish men cry out against admitting a term fashioned by the human mind, they cannot shake our conviction that three are spoken of, each of which is entirely God, yet that there is not more than one God. What wickedness, then, it is to disapprove of words that explain nothing else than what is attested and sealed by Scripture (I.13.3)
  * Terms are important terms for understanding in shorthand what the Scripture says
  * Nothing wrong with wanting to do this in a precise way - precision is not a bad thing
  * We don't want to unduly press terminology such that there is no way one can be orthodox without it
* Calvin: If, therefore, these terms were not rashly invented, we ought to beware lest by repudiating them we be accused of overweening rashness. Indeed, I could wish they were buried, if only among all men this faither were agreed on: that Father and Son and SPirit are one God, yet the Son is not the Father, nor the Spirit the Son, but that they are differentiated by a peculiar quality. (I.13.5)
  * Church existed before us, will continue when we're gone
* Schaff: way in which the Trinity is laid out in Athanasian creed by the church is unsurpassed
  * Man made and not inerrant, but substantial forms of what we claim in theology and they unite the church in significant ways
* Standard Formula
  * One ousia in three hypostases
    * One substance in three persons
    * One in essence, three in persons
  * Substance = Aristotle
    * Being as existing in and by itself, serving as a subject or basis for accidents and accidental change
* The one God is personal in his oneness, not just in his threeness
  * Yet not "person" in the same way
* Arianism continued, because it makes things more understandable or reasonable (yet heretical)
* Council in Constantinople (381)
  * Didn't gain credibility until Calcedon (481)
  * "Exposition of 150 fathers"
  * Creedally very similar to Nicea

  * Spirit is "co-worshiped and co-glorified with Father and Son"
* Anthanasian Creed
  * Attributes are attributes of God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
* Pseudo-Cyril (8th century)
  * Circumincessio
  * Emphasis on the unity of the three - approaches oneness from the perspective of the three
  * Moving from the three to the unity
  * Co-inherence
  * What obtains with respect to the three (knowledge, will, power) is understood with respect to the one
  * No co-inherence of begottenness
  * Is there a distinct self-consciousness of each person?
    * Not in the history of orthodoxy
    * Father is not conscious of anything that the Son and HS are not
  * Essence is not an abstract set of attributes, but a person
* Heresies
  * Dynamic Monarchianism or Adoptionism
    * Theodotus of Byzantium
    * Paul of Samosata
