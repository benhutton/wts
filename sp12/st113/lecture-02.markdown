  * There is a certain centrality to who God is - he is primary in terms of his own design for creation
    * We are not the central focus of God's design
    * Our salvation is not the primary focus of God's design in creation
    * Everything is designed for the glory of God - need to make this real in our own thinking and living

      * To the extent you know God, you know yourself
      * If we focus attention on who God is, we automatically know ourselves
      * Danger in Christian introspection... meant to be focused outward to who God is, then we understand who we are
      * Only way to truly esteem ourselves is to esteem God

    * The will of the Father has become the ministry of the Son
    * Don't come to Christ because of intelligence, but because you recognize your utter dependence for everything including your own knowledge

    * If you think yourself wise and intelligent you move far away from the Gospel

      * Father has his own and gives them to the Son
      * The Son dies for those
      * The HS spirit change their hearts
    * Point 1: The revelation of the knowledge of God is a decidedly Trinitarian activity.
    * Point 2: It is just because the Son knows the Father, that He alone is competent to reveal to us just who the Father is and what He is like.
    * Point 3: This knowledge of the Father is couched in such a way as to be the telos of salvation.
