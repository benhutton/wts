# Relationship between the Church and the Bible

* Don't want to have the impression that medieval theologians had nothing to do with the Bible anymore
  * Though Aristotle was very influential
  * And Biblical usage was very scholarly - common people didn't have the ability to read it
  * Jerome's Latin Vulgate was the proper and useful translation
* Relationship between Scripture and Tradition - 2 trends
  * Single source approach/position
    * Scripture contains all the truths of faith, yet there is a complementary tradition transmitted through the apostles and their successors
    * Tradition is not to be understood as an addition, but as a handing down in living form - a kind of interpretation of scripture
    * Living tradition that continues to grow
    * Not to be understood as having the same authority as scripture, or as adding to scripture
    * Irenaeous and Clement of Alexandria fit in this category
  * Two source tradition
    * Christianity owes equal respect and obedience to what is written in the Bible and the ecclesiastical tradition that is handed down, orally and written, through the apostles and their successors
    * Tradition is added on and enforced within the hierarchy in the church
    * As you move through medieval period, this becomes the dominant understanding
    * Bible is ultimate authority; tradition interprets the Bible and addresses areas the Bible doesn't and so has authority like scripture to function in life of Christians
    * Tradition consists in councils, decrees of popes
    * Doctors/Theologians help people understand what Scripture teaches
    * Canon lawyers help people understand the tradition
    * Pope speaks ex cathedra (infallibly) declaring the position of the church
* What is happening with the use of scripture in the medieval period?
  * Inaccurate to just say it was "allegorical" (over against grammatical/historical)
  * Grammatical-historical move of the reformers laid the ground for the liberal higher-critical studies?
  * Reformers are much closer to medieval exegetes than they are to higher critical exegetes
  * Medieval exegetes weren't as sophisticated with language abilities
  * Continuous progress from medieval period to the reformation
  * Medieval exegetes used a method described as the "quadriga" - a four-fold sense to Scripture
    * Historical sense - original intent
    * Allegorical sense - not just a free for all
    * Tropological sense - understanding of Christ
    * Anagogical sense - eschatology
