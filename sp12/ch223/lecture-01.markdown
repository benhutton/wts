# Introduction and Background

* Focus on the Western church

* 50-70 years ago, historians would have looked at the Medieval period from a very negative perspective
  * Middle Ages, Dark Ages
  * Ancient Church and Reformation/Renaissance were high points, with what happened in between was negative
  * Even some seminaries were negative on the Medieval church
* Opinions have changed slightly
  * Reformation scholars have taught that if you really want to understand the Reformation, you need to understand the Medieval period - that the Reformers were trained in a Medieval system and culture
    * Reformers (Luther to Puritans) are interacting with Medieval theologians (Aquinas, Anselm, etc.)
    * Reformation was only primarily concerned with two major doctrines (Justification, Sacraments)
      * Outside of this (Trinity, Christology), they appealed to earlier works
  * Philosophers influenced by Roman Catholic tradition
    * Much of Catholic theology derives its origin from this period
      * Vatican Exorcist
      * Papal Conclave
    * Philosophers are appealing to Medieval thinkers in their philosophical and theological work
  * We have seen much discussion between RC and Protestants in the last 2 decades
    * Mark Noll - evangelicals and RC are not as dissimilar any more
    * RC and evangelicals have same political social wedge issues
* What is the Medieval period?
  * Cambridge: 300AD = rise of Emperor Constantine
    * Too early
    * Nicea/Trinity was ancient church
  * 500AD to 1500AD
* Postmodern church contextualizing to postmodern culture rejects modern church practices, jumps over reformation to adopt Medieval Church practices
  * Appeal to reason + logic is a rational, modern approach
  * MC appeals to senses (cathedral architecture, bells + chanting, incense, genuflecting + bowing, elevating Lord's Supper)
  * Why did the MC do this? (NOT "is it right?") Then you can see if our context is identical and ought to present the same results?
* NOT going to move lectures linearly through time
  * Instead, trace certain topics and run them through the timeline
  * Thematic approach: highlighting important themes, running them through
* Why begin Medieval period in 500AD? What was the transition point from the Ancient Church?
  * First, need to talk about Roman Empire
    * Western Europeans after the fall of the Empire had a desire to have some form of strong centralized government; still in mind and memory
  * Second, must recognize the legacy of Augustinian theology
    * Luther came from Augustinian Order in the RC church
  * Must recognize schism between Eastern and Western Church
* Augustine
  * Born 354 in Carthage, North Africa
  * Extremely well educated because he came from a Latin-speaking upper-class family
  * Began a career as a rhetorician
    * Became interested in content of arguments as well as the form
  * Mother was a Christian, but poor preaching was a stumbling block
  * Ambrose preached with eloquence and rich theological content
  * Converted in 386, begins theological journey
  * Describes 3 elements of conversion
    * Intellectual conversion: Christianity speaks the truth, and the Christian must understand it.
    * Moral conversion: Christian has the moral strength to live a changed life.
    * Sacramental conversion: When you are baptized; marks the endpoint of your conversion.
  * Does Augustine hold to justification by faith alone?
    * Does not give the same detail wrt conversion that Luther and others had to give.
    * Both RC and Protestants were appealing to Augustine
      * Intellectual could be justification, moral could be sanctification
      * Or conversion could be a seamless progression
    * Monergistic/anti-pelagian
  * Medieval theologians wrestled with all this
    * What is sacramental conversion?
    * When does moral conversion occur? When does it end? Even after death?
  * Describes the question of scripture + its authority + its relationship to the church
    * "I would not have believed unless the authority of the Catholic church had moved me"
    * "I believe in order that I might understand"
    * Faith is required for conversion, but you go to the church to receive that faith
    * Has a very high ecclesiology
    * Ministry of the church is the ministry of the Gospel - its where you come to understand
    * If you are not in the church, you are not really a Christian
    * Church has a very central role in the life of a Christian
    * In Medieval Church, centrality of the church remains, but authority/gospel changes
      * Some took "move me" to mean "compel me"
        * Real authority of the church over the lives of the believers
        * Inquisition, persecuting and physically compelling one to a theological standpoint
  * Donatists controversy makes it clear what he means by the church
    * Because of persecution, many abandoned the faith, wanted to come back in
    * Donatists didn't want to welcome these people back in - didn't consider baptisms legitimate
    * Donatists pulled out of the church and formed their own church - essentially a new denomination
    * Augustine: "You cannot have God as your father without the church as your mother"
    * Didn't consider donatists to be the church, or Christian, even though in terms of theology, practice, belief they aren't very different
    * Begins to wrestle with distinction between invisible and visible church
      * Invisible = elect, at any time and any place
      * Visible = people there on Sunday
      * Saw invisible church as a subset of the visible church
    * Donatists were not part of the same Visible church
    * Augustine made an allowance for the Donatists to be part of the Invisible church, but thought that they needed to come back
    * Eventually Donatists are brought back in
  * By the end of his career, Augustine is witnessing the fall of the Roman Empire
    * Theological and political questions about why the crumbling is happening
    * Some blamed the Christianity for making the Empire weak
      * Empire grew through military conquest
      * Now religion is telling us to love each other and forgive one another
      * Old gods were gods of war
    * Church is worried about whether it will survive if the Empire falls
    * In response to this, Augustine writes *The City Of God*
      * Not making the empire weak
        * Appeals to the question of virtue
        * Actions are done for the benefit of the many, not the one
        * Christian virtues outmatch and go beyond pagan virtues
        * Roman Empire is built on virtues, and Christian virtues exceed Christian virtues
      * There is a distinction between the City of God and the City of Man
        * City of God can never crumble
        * No matter what happens in the City of Man
        * Can't withdraw from City of Man because we're in the City of God
        * In City of Man, doesn't matter if you have a Christian Emperor; City of God will continue because God preserves it. 
        * Would rather have a just pagan ruler than an unjust Christian ruler.
        * Explore how to engage in the City of Man while in the City of God
        * Church exists to welcome everyone to worship God.
        * Justice is that which produces peace. Church can do its job best in this context.
        * Ultimately justice comes from God - God is the one who is truly just. If you are a question who studies God's word, then you have a better understanding of justice.
        * Thus, Christians need to engage the state to encourage it to be just.
        * NOT talking about the institutional Church informing the state, but individual Christians.
        * Arguing for the distinction between the church and the state.
    * Empire is shattered, Europe is ruled as separate nations according to ethnic lines
      * As Europe politically separates, the church maintains centrality and unity
      * The Church serves as the unifying point of all of Europe
      * Augustine's distinction isn't observed; Christian King or Queen will appeal to religion and be influenced by authority of church
      * Church holds the unity together even when the empire falls
      * Church holds power and authority in relationship to Europe
      * Secular authorities will submit themselves or see themselves as equal to the church
      * Even original WCF allowed for king of England to call councils of the church
