      * Some as prefaces to his own translations
* The Periphyseon
  * Tried to construct a synoptic view of life
  * Makes a fundamental distinction between things that are and things that are not
    * All things are divided between things that are and things that are not
    * Taken together, they make up nature
    * Nature is the sum of reality
  * How can things that are not be included in the totality of all that is?
    * Repudiated the disjunction between being and nothingness
    * None of the things that are not are sheer nothing
    * There are several modes of non-being
      * Sinful man
      * Changing particulars
      * Potential being
      * Anything beyond our intellect
  * "Those things only truly are which are comprehended by the intellect alone"
    * Reality is defined by the mind of man
    * If it can't be comprehended by the intellect alone, it has a kind of non-being to it
  * Neo-platanist - identified God with the form of the good
  * God is beyond being
    * God may truly be said not to be
    * Wanted to maintain that God is beyond the human intellect, so he held that God is beyond being
    * If the human mind could comprehend God, then God would belong to the class of things that are
  * If we make affirmative statements about God, then they must be qualified with negative statements
    * And vice versa
    * Although God is more like goodness than like badness and more like being than like nothingness, these positive assertions are not wholly true.
    * Misleading unless supplemented by corresponding opposite assertions
    * If we say that God is being, we must also say that he is not being
      * God is not being because he is more than being
    * If we say that God is good, we must also say that he is not good
      * God is not good because he is more than good
  * Hegel recognized in some of these ideas some aspects that belong to his own philosophy
  * Two avoid making double assertions, he combined affirmative and negative statements to say things like: "God is super-good"
    * Super-essence, super-good, super-true
  * Philosophers have challenged whether these terms mean anything extra
  * Notion of dependence is a two way relationship
    * If creation is dependent on God, then in a certain sense God is dependent on creation
    * Dependence implies inclusiveness - a mutuality between two objects
  * The world is a theophany of God - an appearance of God
    * God is limitless and so is directly unknowable
    * God is known indirectly through theophanies
    * Attempt to maintain both transcendence and imminence of God
  * Knowledge is illumination
    * If everything that exists is an aspect of the divine nature reflected from some perspective or other, then in knowing the things around us we know God
    * Not God as he is in his super-essential nature, but God insofar as he has externalized himself
  * All knowledge is an act of grace, by means of which God illumines our minds
  * Periphyseon is his own reworking of permanence, procession, and return (neoplatonic triad)
    * Structures the universe
    * 4-fold division of nature
      * That which is not created and creates (God)
        * Book one
      * That which is created and creates (Platonic archetypes)
        * Book two - primordial causes by which God creates all other things
        * Got him into trouble
        * Book was condemned and ordered to be burned
        * Viewed as problematic and inconsistent with historic christianity
      * That which is created and does not create (the physical universe)
        * Made by God indirectly by primordial causes
        * Doesn't make other things
        * Book 3 = creation of non-human nature
        * Book 4 = study of man
      * That which is not created and does not create (God)
        * Viewed as the goal, the end of all things
        * All things which go from him and through the primordial causes return to him
        * God issues into the world and then returns to himself
        * A sense in which God does create and does not create
        * God is purpose, end, telos
    * God is the beginning, middle, and end. All things are from him, subsist in him, and go to him.
* What was his understanding of the relationship between faith and reason?
  * Maintained that faith and reason must harmonize with each other
  * "There is no doubt that reason and authority both flow from one fountain, namely divine wisdom, so no authority should frighten you away from these things... true authority does not oppose right reason"
  * Two different sources of truth
    * That which is revealed on authority
    * That which man's reason discovers
  * Never have a genuine conflict
  * How do you handle apparent conflicts between faith and reason?
    * Follow reason which investigates the truth, is overpowered by nothing and impeded by nothing
  * Every authority which is not approved by true reason is seen to be weak
* Important figure in Medieval Europe
  * His writings clearly demonstrate that the early middle ages (and Carolingian renaissance of 9th century) was not a period of intellectual barrenness but rather one of vitality and creativity
    * Contitutes an important contribute to the platonic and neoplatonic tradition
    * Just as Aquinas represented synthesis between Christian and Aristotelian thought
  * Translations from Greek into Latin provided access to those in the Latin West who did not know Greek
    * Stimulated himself and others
  * Notion of the neoplatonic triad and four-fold division of nature
    * Signify a bold and innovative approach to metaphysical issues

      * Explicitly stated that he was building off of Augustine's work on the Trinity
    * Proslogion
      * Discourse on the nature and attributes of God

      * Produced arguments that were not easily dismissed or refuted
  * Canterbury - 1093-1109

    * Rejected by Aquinas
    * Embraced by continental rationalists - Decartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz
    * Rejected by Kant
    * Idealists of 19th and 20th centuries accepted some forms of this
    * Contemporary philosophers (like Plantiga) accepted
  * Example of high middle ages' creative and philosophical thinking... philosophers can't put it to death
  * Does not explicate what is a common and intuitive notion about God
    * Cosmological and teleological arguments argue from more common notions
  * Purely a priori; no appeal to the external world
  * Very conception of God requires his existence; the essence of God requires his existence
  * Not entirely consistent in working out principle of fides quaerens intellectum (faith seeking understanding)
    * "No christian ought to dispute the truth of what the church teaches"
    * Augustine = "I believe in order to understand"
    * Assumes at a number of points the truth of scripture, but tries to prove his case on rational grounds alone (undermining arguments)
    * Attempts to be augustinian in that reason is founded upon faith, but is inconsistent
  * God is all-perfect, existence is entailed from very nature
    * God is perfect
    * Perfection entails existence
    * Therefore God exists
  * Gaunilo provided perfect island objection - he could conceive of a perfect island, and just because he can conceive of it does not mean that it necessarily exists
    * Anselm says that they're using the word "perfect" differently (because God is not in a class such that he can be compared with other things)
