## Quadriga

* Medieval interpretation of scripture
  * How to distinguish between the letter and the spirit? Israel and church? OT and NT?
  * Need to look at the OT with greater meaning than just the literal historical sense. To take it literally does not take into account its meaning for the church today.
  * Historical/literal sense tells you what really happened
  * Allegorical sense points you to understand what is going on beyond historical sense.
  * Tropological sense gives you a moral declration/imperative
  * Anagogical sense leads you to the higher things, the heavenly things, and hte direction that God is taking all things to their final end
* Historical/literal sense
  * Encompasses all genres, not just narrative
  * Serves as the foundation for all the other senses
  * For example, what was the temple of God, historically, to Israel? What happened there? Who served there?
  * Need to understand all of this first, to understand the spiritual senses
* Allegorical sense
  * Refers to mystery
  * (Not mystical)
  * Something that was hidden that is now revealed
  * "The apostles taught us to look for the secret of the truth in the simplicity of the history." - Ambrose
  * The two keys to unlock this are Christ and the Church
  * Allegorical meaning of temple: Christ is the true temple, the one who makes the ultimate sacrifice, who gathers together his people, the Church
  * NOT free-ranging pick whatever you want from your imagination
  * Very specific sense of mystery to be revealed - Christ + his Church
  * Could describe this as a Christocentric focus
* Tropological sense
  * In passing from history to allegory, we pass from the letter to the spirit
  * Edification of morals as the goal of the passage
  * What the passage teaches in terms of what is required to obey, to fulfill, to continue to move in your spiritual life
  * Tropological meaning of temple: how you ought to live and worship
* Anagogical sense
  * Eschatalogical sense
  * Pointing to heaven and final end
  * Ultimate end, in which God is bringing all things to their conclusion
  * Ultimate goal is union
  * Anagogical meaning of city of Jerusalem: pointing us to the new Jerusalem, the final Jerusalem

* Calvin's Method
  * Historical Sense
    * Tried to get at literal meaning both historically and grammatically
    * Had tools - Greek and Hebrew - that medievals did not have
  * Spiritual Sense
    * Not explicitly broken up into quadriga
    * Recognized that there was a greater/deeper meaning than the grammar and historical context
    * Deeper sense that points to Christ and his Church, points to the eternal kingdom, and has moral standards that we ought to obey
* Puritan method was the same - literal and spiritual senses
* "Superiority of pre-critical exegesis"
  * Real divide is not between medievals and reformers, but with the higher-critical school that insists on a literal approach (and no spiritual approach)
  * Everyone is trying to find the "real history", which is the "truth" for them (and only leaves you with some moral examples)

# Reactions to Thomas Aquinas in Late Medieval Scholasticism

* Aquinas was not accepted in every area
* A school of theology reacted to his philosophical approach
* John Dunn Scotus (1266-1308)
  * Born in Scotland
  * Join Franscicans
  * Taught at Oxford, Paris, Cologne
  * Wrote commentaries on Aristotle's philosophy and Lombard's theology
  * Explored issues that led him to modify Aquinas
* William Occam (1287-1349)
  * Taught at Oxford, Munich
  * Fransciscans
  * More radical, criticized church on moral issues
    * Church was beginning to indulge itself too much in material gain
    * Condemned by pope for criticisms and excommunicated
* Via Antiqua
  * Aquinas' approach
  * He was a realist
  * Analogy of being, in which God as he relates to the world has done so by analogy: existence of all things by participation in the divine being
    * Creatures, our existence, and what we know about the created world, we know it by participation in God (what God shows us tells us what is out there in the world around us)
    * When we speak and use words as creatures, we are referring to things that are external to us ("Look at the chair"). We know them because God created them and presented them to us
    * We can know God because he has revealed himself to us through what he has created
    * References in language refer to things created and outside of us - they're real objects
  * We know God because he has revealed himself to us, in terms of his very essence. God is not tricking us or presenting himself in some false way to us
    * Supernatural theology/revelation reveals God (scripture)
    * General revelation reveals God in creation - who God is in terms of his being
  * If God has revealed himself in Scripture, he's revealed his real self
* Via Moderna
  * Scotus and Occam and others
  * They were nominalists
  * Language and other things outside of ourselves, in the external world, are features of the mind - what we think in our minds - and not necessarily objects as they really are
  * Something seemed contradictory wrt freedom of God and relationship of creature to creator
    * If creation is tied to reveal God's being, then creature and creator are too tied together. Could God have created differently? Would that mean his being is different?
    * Instead, what God has revealed to us communicates God's will, not his essence
      * Absolute will - his true freedom, he can create anything he wants to create; all options are open - world could look very different form ours
        * Absolute knowledge
      * Ordained will - God chooses to ordain things in a certain way; to create in a certain way; we experience, in this world, God's ordained will, not his absolute will
        * Ordained knowledge
    * Preserves God's freedom and the distinction between creator and creature
    * What we know is true, but not identical with God's being
  * For example, God's knowledge of the Trinity is infinitely greater than ours is; our understanding at any point can never be considered to be identical
    * We know only what God wants us to know
  * This then leads into discussions of prolegomena
    * Archetypal - God's theology, what God knows. How he understands himself and theology
    * Ectypal - God has revealed theology suitable for the creature to understand, according to his will, to teach and instruct us, that we can grasp
      * Adam - revealed to Adam before the Fall - understood them in a way that we couldn't
      * Christ - incarnate, so he assumes an ectypal theology
      * In via - pilgrim theology, given to us, that we are to understand
        * Supernatural
        * Natural
  * Protestants follow up to this point, but then add a distinction
    * Supernatural
      * Unregenerate - NONE
      * Regenerate - only regenerate people can understand what the Bible is teaching (though sinful mind degrades understanding, such as with baptism - differences and understanding are in us, not the bible)
    * Natural
      * Unregenerate - only thing you can understand is that there is a God, and that God condemns you (Romans 1) (Scotus would say that if your mental faculties worked, you could understand a lot)
      * Regenerate - 
  * Occam is willing to move in certain Pelagian directions - God's grace cooperates with us
    * We must make ourselves more loving and loveable
    * Never moved far enough to see difference between regenerate and unregenerate
    *
