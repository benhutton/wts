* By 476, end of last great Roman emperor
  * Others will claim, but no one will have same rule, authority, extent
  * Always will be a nostalgia to go back to the RE, to reclaim what was lost
* Church will be central institution binding Europe together even with the fall of RE
* Controversy centering on who Christ is
  * Patristic Council of Chalcedon produces specific statement on 2 natures of Christ - hypostatic union
    * Heresy: Eutychianism - Christ has one nature, not two; human nature dropped off
    * Heresy: Appolynarianism - Christ has divine nature with an earth suit - part divine, part human
    * Heresy: Nestorianism - divine and human so separate that there were almost 2 different people
    * Truth: Christ is fully God, fully man, in one person.
  * Some problems emerged
    * How does Christ not now the hour of his coming?
    * Why does Christ pray, "take this cup from me"?
    * Why does Christ seem limited - not omniscient or knowing divine will
    * Was the temptation of Christ in fact a true temptation?
  * Does Christ have one will or two?
    * Does he have just a divine will, or a human will as well?
    * Is there a schizophrenic Jesus, where the wills are in tension?
    * Monothalite view - 1 will
      * No opposition or conflict (like Trinity)
    * Diothalite view - 2 wills
      * If Christ is truly human, he ought to have a human will as well
      * How then do these wills interact?
      * Church took this side
      * Human will is always submissive to the divine
        * Human will is passive, divine will is active
      * Jesus has every component Adam had before the Fall
      * Impossible to sin because he's divine
      * Has the full faculties to sin because he's human
        * He has hunger, etc.

      * Commemoration, not repetition of sacrifice
    * In 850s, no conclusion

      * Reads Radbertus' writing
      * Finds them to be mysterious and suspicious
      * Argues against the body and blood changing

# History of Islam

* Understanding first contact between Christianity and Islam is important for understanding things today
  * Crusades have had strong impact on certain perceptions of the West
  * Not everything goes back to medieval period - some to 1800s
* Presupposition: continual growth of the church is the result of the work of the Spirit
  * One could argue that Islam is growing at a faster rate
  * Look into secondary causes for understanding why Islam is growing like it is (because its not the HS)
* Mohammed began to preach in Mecca around 610
  * Mecca becomes center of Islam and original point of Islamic conversions
  * Why Mecca? Why was this all so attractive?
    * One option: Transition to merchantile economy undermined the traditional order in Mecca, generating a social and moral malaise, to which Mohammed's preaching was a response
      * Socio-economic disparity influenced a growing lower class (very Marxist)
    * Other option: Trade city, but not luxury goods. Hard to justify that there was this kind of malaise. Social structures were tribal units - families and extended families that support one another. (Not western social class structure.) So not Mecca.
    * Third option: Wasn't Mecca, but Medina where Mohammed became so influential and popular. Raised up an army and travelled back to Mecca (pilgrimage). Monotheism becomes attractive to Medinan polytheists. 
      * Tribal units are not a nation - cannot defend themselves well - very vulnerable
        * What is the destiny of man?
        * Message would unite tribal units around religious ideology
        * "Arab World" - collective identity to what it means to be "Arab" - Islam was unifying feature that created Arab identity
        * Monotheistic, extended through jihad (you can just convert and be treated as a brother in the faith - nationality doesn't matter)
* What Mohammed actually taught, and its implications
  * You live in total resignation to God. Life, actions, everything submitted to the will of Allah.
  * Old tradition: Mecca was the place that Adam visited after the Fall; Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt it after the flood; stone that was originally white was now black as a result of the Fall
    * Polytheism
    * Born already circumcised with seal of prophecy on his back
    * Illiterate but dictated Koran
  * No doctrine of inspiration where you have divine and human authors
    * Koran was dictated in Arabic by God to Mohammed
    * Believed that angel Gabriel called him to be a messenger of God
  * Left for Medina, then came back to purify Mecca
  * "There is one God, and Mohammed is his prophet."
  * Jesus is not son of God, no Trinity
  * Dies in Mecca
  * Followers adopted a policy that would continue to spread teaching through warfare
    * "Sword is key to heaven and hell."
  * Extension through North Africa through conquest
  * By 737, cross into Spain
  * By 9th century, into Persia, Afghanistan, and India
* Theology
  * One God, object of fear and reverence
  * Practice through strict discipline
  * Prayer 5 times a day
  * Give alms to the poor
  * Fast during month of Rammadan
  * Pilgrimage to Mecca
