# Towards the Eve of the Reformation

* Medieval nominalism as the philosophical framework
  * Robert Holcot - died in 1349 - British nominalist
    * Also Gabriel Biel
    * Influential on Luther's theological construction and structures
    * Known for commentary on "Biblical Wisdom" - "Wisdom is a gift from God. Man's claim that he can have a natural knowledge of God is false."
    * Has the Realist school of Aquinas in mind - can't get knowledge of God or salvation by reason and looking at general revelation
    * Wisdom of God stands over against the wisdom of man
    * Not afraid to engage with pagan philosophers of the ancient period
    * Denying that the natural knowledge is one in which you can innately or achieve according to reason that you possess
    * Not a sceptic - not saying that you can't know anything by reason and should doubt everything
    * Trying to fall back on Augustinian tradition
      * Luther was in an Augustinian order as well
    * Argued that those who have the knowledge of God would need to receive it either from God (revelation) or in some other form that was passed down
      * How is it possible that Aristotle + others are so smart and useful?
      * How is it that those pagan philosophers who had no contact with the Biblical record are instructed by God, instead of their own rational argumentations, to come to truth?
      * Must have been instructed by God at some point
      * Oral and written traditions passed down by Adam, his children, and the holy prophets must have reached the Greek philosophers
        * Not Scripture in its canonized form
        * No Bible, but still some knowledge of the truth in traditions that were extracanonical
      * Human faculties are insufficient, so God's grace must be extended to give them knowledge of the truth (oral or written tradition)
    * Faith is not contrary to reason, but faith goes beyond reason
      * Not a denial of reason, but recognizing that reason requires grace
      * Grace will then grow your faith and move you to accept and understand the truth that God has given
      * The church provides this grace - gives the most solid basis for understanding the truth God has given
        * Has Bible, authority, sacraments
      * Not a negation of reason but a pointing to the grace of God in the church
      * Others receive the grace of God, too, which is how they arrive at such helpful philosophical truths
    * Does not believe that man, by his own power, can acquire a saving knowledge of God. Needs the grace of God. This is what makes him feel consistent with Augustine.
    * Is predestination based on foreknowledge of future good works?
      * God only wants those to be saved who live according to the laws established by him
      * How do you reconcile this?
      * Does not deny that there is grace given, but it is grace that is used by the individual
      * God is then committed to give his grace according to his sovereign pleasure and decrees - grace would be extended to whoever
      * God in fact gives grace to all - has done so according to his sovereign pleasure and is free to do so
      * In his absolute power, God is free to do that, and that demonstrates his will and desire to give grace to all
      * In his ordained power, God freely establishes in eternity a law according to which the grace will be given
      * Chooses a particular way in which mercy and grace are shown/received that makes full use of man's natural capacities
        * Pactum - relationship between God - makes grace available through natural capacities of the individual, using natural abilities to receive that grace
      * Predestination doesn't refer to individuals, but to the way in which the grace is expressed
      * What are natural capabilities? The way you come to receive the grace... in the church... in the sacraments
      * Not doing this by your own powers because its extended by the grace of God first
        * Natural abilities are not enough
        * Whatever you're doing is congruent merit
        * Engages the church in the sacramental system
      * Reformers see it as semi-pelagian - cooperation of God's grace with human abilities
    * "God does not deny grace to one who does what is in his or her power."
      * If you come and you take, God won't deny you
      * This is Holcot's answer to the question of assurance
    * Nominalism is attached to Augustinianism
      * Pointing men like Luther back to Augustine, but through lens of nominalism
* Medieval Mysticism
  * Not an antithesis to scholastic rationalism
  * In fact, went hand in hand with those who were very interested in scholasticism
  * A way in which you practiced the life taught in scholastic schools
  * Way to God is through experience of the soul with God, and with the mind
  * What is this experience of the soul?
    * Supplements the rational investigation
    * This has become again something very popular for postmodern Christians to look at
  * Illumination -> Purgation -> Union
    * As one comes to understand, accompanied by purging of sin and detachment of the world, leading to union with Christ
  * There are things that we can know through our senses, but there is much more out there in terms of knowledge, to be understood apart from senses
    * There are things that can be known by reason
    * But there is also a path to knowledge beyond reason
    * There's a spark in our soul that knows God directly, apart from reason + senses
  * This spark transcends reason + senses
  * Cultivating a three-fold path toward union
    * Reason
    * Senses
    * Mystical side of your soul
  * What does this spark mean?
    * Spark or essence of humanity is ultimately lost in the being of God - connection between God and ourselves where we have something in us like God
      * Objection: this moves in pantheistic direction
    * Platonic sense: divine spark and from that emanating out of God, smaller sparks that end up with us and our desires to return back to original origin with God
    * That which if we emphasize it too much, it would undermine the institution of the church (why would we need to be taught or receive the sacraments)
    * Ultimately: an ethical change within the individual. Not losing yourself in God, but being conformed more and more by the character of God
    * Achieved through contemplation + meditation + focusing on the things of God
      * "Need to know myself and turn away and liberate my mind and contemplate God."
      * Contemplation still involved use of reason + mind
    * Connecting your soul to spiritual truth in such a way that it will ethically change you
    * For example, contemplate hell and what it will be like, what the eternal damnation will be like
    * Contemplation is intended to liberate the mind and focus you more on God
      * Doubts, struggles, questions should be put aside
  * Meiser Eckhart (1260-1327)
    * Dominican monk, studied in Paris
    * Came under investigation for disregard of scholastic writings
    * Mysticism = calm and quiet form of contemplation
    * Speaks of soul dissolving itself into God
    * Movement towards God, spark connected with God
    * Theology condemned by the Pope in the 1329
      * Moving too far in antirational direction
  * Johann Tauler (1300-1361)
    * Disciple of Eckhart
    * Stressed humility
    * Teologica Germanica - influenced Luther
    * "For in whatsoever creature the perfect shall be known, the creature qualities... must be lost and done away with."
      * Natural capabilities must ultimately pass
      * Talking about union
    * "They ultimately know God by ceasing to be separate with God, by ceasing to have individuality apart from God."
    * Movement toward union is mystical (directing spiritual eternal eye - must be focused on this)
    * Ultimately a desire to imitate Christ - deny oneself and seek the mystical calling to be united with Christ
      * Christ lived a life of sorrow - ought to be our experience as well
  * Accounts of supernatural experiences
    * Those who were really advanced towards mystical union
    * Levitation
    * Stigmata
    * Visions
    * Have women writing records of mystical experiences
* By the eve of the reformation, Church had established itself as the religious institution in Europe
  * Had massive influence
  * Church became extremely wealthy through tithing and indulgences
  * Corruption emerging in the church
    * Caused those who followed the ascetic lifestyle would look at this and wonder how spiritual they really were
  * Theology was scrutinized as well
* Lollards
  * John Wycliffe (1384)
  * Referred to "weeds"
  * Relationship of Lollards to Wycliffe
    * Some claim Lollards were movement dedicated to spreading Wycliffe's teaching
    * Others claim it was a group within the church who saw a threat and tried to address it
  * Growing influence of Wycliffe
    * 1380, gave a series of lectures opposing transubstantiation
      * Argued that Aquinas' position was incorrect - that the accidents could exist without the substance
      * This would call into question all confidence in the material world as we know it
      * Has biblical and philosophical objections
      * Shows transubstantiation has no basis in scripture
      * Looks back to patristics to help understand the true theology of the church
      * Bread + wine was sign + presence of the body of Christ. It was Christ's body sacramentally and spiritually
        * Spiritual presence, not physical presence of Christ
      * One Lollard text called transubstantiation the idea of the antichrist
  * Lollards' complaints
    * Other Lollards began to reject penance + oral confession
      * "Sorrow of heart alone destroys every sin"
      * "Confession is needful, but to Christ, not to a priest"
      * Not as if priest pronounces absolution and then has the right to tell you what penance to do
      * Only God knows the truly penitent and can truly forgive sins
    * Some Lollards went even farther and rejected the monastic orders in the church
      * Began to promote a private religion
    * Questioned the use of images within worship
      * Failure to adhere to the first commandment
      * Caused errors of faith and promoted idolatry - the worship of creature rather than creator
    * Questioned devotion to saints
  * How are they understanding the Bible? How do they have access to the Bible? 
    * Centerpiece of Wycliffe was his understanding of the authority of Scripture
    * Scripture with all its truth claims must be the measure with which we measure all other things
    * Thus, we should read God's word... in the vernacular... and allow access for everyone
    * We should give the Bible to everyone
    * Produced english translation of the bible
      * 1382 and 1395
    * Produced aids for studying the bible like commentaries and an early concordance
    * Churches emphasized preaching + exegesis
    * Catholic Church was very concerned to shut down this movement
      * By 1409, Bishop forbid the Wycliffe translation of the Bible
      * Bishop ordered that preaching be done on the sacraments
  * Others were criticizing theology and doing something highly illegal (translating the bible)
* Jan Huss
  * Born in Bohemia
  * Attended University of Prague, began teaching there
  * Research focused on Lord's Supper
    * Disagreed with the church, arguing that the cup should be given to everyone (church argued that cup was more holy)
  * Considered the established church to be an oppressive hierarchy
  * 1408 - ordered to stop his preaching and teaching
  * 1410 - books were publically burned
  * Adamantly insisted that one could not be both righteous and a sinner at the same time
    * Either justified or not - cannot be both
    * Not biblical to talk about justification in some kind of progressive direction
  * Part of apocolyptic environment
    * Followers saw themselves as God's chosen people anointed to defeat antichrist, satan, and all unrighteousness
    * Secular law should be replaced by divine law
    * Material possessions should be shared
    * This would usher in eschaton
  * Left Prague
  * Summoned to council to defend positions
    * Views condemned as heretical
    * Burned at the stake (even though he was promised safe passage - they considered promises to heretics no longer valid)
* Eve of reformation sets the stage for what comes later
  * Breakthrough = reformation had a background; ideas did not spring to life ex nihilo or from an objective study of the bible alone
* Connections with Luther
  * Luther = a late medieval scholastic theologian
  * Had not yet been bathed fully in the atmosphere of the renaissance + humanism (like Calvin was)
  * Only has major concerns with two loci of systematic theology
    * Justification
    * Sacraments
  * Preface to Commentary on Psalms - hated law and requirements of righteousness, until he understood that the righteousness of God was a gift
  * Not the first to ask this question
  * How did Luther come to this?
    * Was meditating on a passage, light shone on it, he understood it in a different way
    * Practically, he was following a particular method of understanding scripture
      * Meditating, focusing himself on spiritual things
    * Christ had been seen as a legislator who required obedience to a new law
      * Seemed to be better to be in the OT - NT just added more
    * How much is enough?
      * Mystical tradition leads him to ask how much he must do to move towards union
    * Righteousness is something given to us, not something to be lived up to
  * Luther advances himself in medieval university because he's brilliant
    * Becomes teacher, scholar, doctor of divinitatis - has privilege of teaching from Scripture
    * Now studying the Bible, having mastered medieval texts
    * Renaissance has begun - has access to the Bible in its original language
  * Sees classic interpretation wrt righteousness doesn't match with Greek NT in Romans
  * Also a spiritual journey, encouraged by mystical background he received
    * Admits that access to hidden things is a rare event
    * Mystical theology is part of his overall understanding of the Gospel
    * Pervades understanding of everything
    * Human senses + intellect are important, but we meditate on what Christ did for us
    * "What did Christ do for you?"
    * If I'm pursuing Christ, what do I need to think about, and how does that change me ethically?
    * What did Christ do on the cross for us?
      * Luther = theologian of the cross
    * We find ourselves at the cross, as Christ dies for us - our sins on the cross
    * The God who is there on the cross is to be understood in an Augustinian way, focused on the issue of regeneration
    * Regeneration will ultimately determine how you will see the cross
      * Revealed God
        * What does the world see when they look at the cross?
        * Someone who is just a man hanging there
        * Someone who is convicted as a criminal
        * Someone who is defeated
      * Hidden God
        * If you're regenerate, you see God incarnate
        * You see someone who is the only righteous one
        * You see God's victory
        * How do you see? Faith
    * This is what you're supposed to meditate on and contemplate
    * There's glory of the Cross to be seen and understood - this will cause a change in you and transform you
  * Moving towards heaven is a battle
    * We participate in this battle as soldiers of the cross
    * Meditation prepares you for this battle
    * Who is the enemy? Satan
    * Cannot forget that Satan is out there attempting to thwart the plans of God
    * Everything for Luther is framed in a spiritual battle - are you with God or against God? Is HS with you, or are you of a different spirit?
    * Anyone who opposes him is of the Devil
      * Says that Zwingli is of a different spirit after their debate
    * NOT a precursor to enlightenment rationalism
    * Mystical dimension says that there is a spiritual dimension to everything that's going on 
  * Union is still the goal - "The true theologian is borne in rapture and ecstasy"
    * There's a spiritual formation for the theologian
