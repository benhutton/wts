# Medieval Scholasticism

* In previous historical studies, this has been viewed negatively
  * Seen as theologians moving away from Biblical studies and making speculative or archane Aristotelian conclusions
* But now...
  * Exegetical
  * Philosophy handmaiden to theology - not fundamentally antichristian
    * Necessary, helpful tool
  * Tried to construct a rational, consistent, coherent, systematic theology
    * Does this require that the person approaching the system have an understanding of faith?
    * In principle, sided with Augustine - theology requires faith
    * Nevertheless, that theology is rational and consistent and can be demonstrated to be such
  * Aristotle's philosophy
    * Extremely helpful tool
    * In the West, had more access to his Ethical works
    * In the East, had more access to his Logical works
    * Crusades opened up Logical works to the West
  * Theology maturing such that systematic theologians are writing systematic theologies
    * Came out of a desire to train (in medieval universities - need a curriculum and pedagogical method)
    * Universities established in 11th century through permission of the church/charter of the Pope
    * University of Paris, Cologne, Patua, Erefort, Oxford, Cambridge, St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen
  * Could also study law or medicine
  * What is to be taught, and how?
    * Theology was the queen of the sciences
      * Considered to be the highest level of study
    * Needed to cover every loci of theology that needed to be mastered to enter into ministry
      * From Lombard to Aquinas, systematics...
    * Patterns of pedagogy
      * Looked to Aristotle here for how to lay out material in a way a student can master in an effective way
  * Scholasticism has two parts: content and method
    * Protestant scholasticism has different content and similar methods
* Trends that began to emerge
  * Faculty had 2 responsibilities: teaching/training and research/writing
  * Ontology
    * Questions of being focused on questions of existence
    * What does it mean for God or the world to exist? How do we relate to that?
    * Can you prove the existence of God?
    * How do you understand the essence of something?
    * How do you understand change and causality?
  * Epistemology
    * How do we know what we know?
    * How does knowledge come to us?
    * How do we receive that knowledge in terms of human senses? Can our senses deceive us?
      * Transubstantiation - how do we know bread and wine have changed?
* St. Anselm (1033-1109)
  * Described as a second Augustine
  * Favorite phrase = "Faith seeking understanding"
    * Understanding and knowledge are to be sought through faith
    * Not just acquiring data
    * "Understanding" moves you into the biblical category of wisdom
      * Has component of knowledge (scientia)
      * That knowledge must have an impact on you
      * Biblical wisdom is knowledge that changes your life
    * This is all sought through faith
    * Intellect and use of reason are gifts of God
      * If you don't use them, you're neglecting the gift of God
    * Here, the Medievals got it right
  * Wrote 3 major books
    * Monologion
      * Discussed doctrine of God in terms of basic understanding of who God is
    * Proslogion
      * How we understand or prove the existence of God
        * Context was NOT trying to persuade atheists
          * Involved in debates with other Christians
          * Trying to show as an act of devotion and worship that God does exist and we can show it logically and rationally
        * The argument...
          * Biblical fool says "God does not exist"
          * Let's define God: "The being which no greater being can be conceived"
          * Fool can agree with this definition
          * At this point, the fool has understood in his mind the conception of this God
          * Fool has the idea of this being in his mind but denies that the reality of the being exists outside of his mind
          * Such a being which exists in the mind alone, is a being in which a greater being can be conceived, since it is greater to exist in the mind and reality
            * Reality is always greater than idea
        * Not arguing for Christian Theism - just for a generic theism
          * NOT an apologist; not arguing against Islam or Judaism
        * Aristotelian logic - no Biblical references or prooftexts
          * Aristotle argues that reality is greater than mind
        * Position of the fool is self-contradictory
        * Big issue in western philosophy: how do we understand the relationship between mind and reality?
    * Cur Deus Homo - "Why The God-Man?"
      * The question of the atonement
        * In dealing with man's sin, man is hopeless and helpless - cannot pay for the punishment of sin himself
        * God cannot and will not allow his most precious creation to perish
          * Very purpose and nature of God will not allow him to condemn all men
        * Therefore God must find a way to deal with the sin problem
        * Man ought but cannot, God can but ought not
        * Solution = Jesus Christ the God-Man
        * Jesus is God, acquires an infinite merit, such that his dying can pay the penalty for all those who would be redeemed
      * Problem is the necessity of atonement in God himself
        * Other option was the ransom theory of the atonement
          * Anselm rejects this
        * Atonement is necessary because of God's love, not because of God's wrath
        * Calvin and other theologians liked satisfaction (not ransom), Jesus as God-man, but NOT the issue of necessity
          * For Calvin, after God chooses to save, then it is a consequent absolute necessity. But he chooses freely
* Abelard (1079-1142)
  * One of Anselm's chief adversaries
  * Heralded in literature as a romantic figure because of exchange of letters with a woman
  * Not a monk, but was devoted to Christianity and ultimately moved towards theological writing
  * Understanding of atonement had an interesting position on atonement
    * Strictly an example or representation of God's love
    * God evokes from us love by generating his own love
    * Any notion of appeasing God is inappropriate to the nature of God
    * If God required payment for Adam's sin, how much more payment would be required for putting Christ to death?
    * Death was not atoning, but shows God's love
* Peter Lombard (1100-1160)
  * Born in Italy, became a bishop
  * Produced most influential theological textbook for those training for ministry
    * In English as "Peter Lombard's Sentences"
    * Early systematic theology book
    * Incorporated into university curricula
    * Four books
      * Doctrine of the Trinity
      * Creation and Sin
      * The Incarnation and Christian Virtue
      * Sacraments and Eschatology
    * Heavily influenced by Augustine
    * Others would write commentaries on it
    * Senior faculty could teach from scripture; junior faculty would teach from Lombard
* Much comes out of Medieval Monasticism
  * Built on asceticism
  * Placed focus on Christian to be in a context in which they can pray and devote themselves to Christ
    * More rigorous form of Christian living
  * Became part of social structure and offered 3rd option: nobility, commoners, clergy, and monks
    * Distinct from clergy but devoted to the church
  * Intended to live in a way to devote themselves to Christ and the church
  * Monks were ordained as monks
  * Two monastic orders emerged - the Mendicant orders 
    * Means "to beg" - devotion to absolute poverty
    * Needed to break cycle of wealth and corruption that would lead Christians astray
    * Would not withdraw from society but be involved in the work of the church in the world
    * Influential in establishing medieval universities
    * And encouraging the people in spiritual growth
    * And pledged allegiance directly to the Pope
  * Francis of Assissi (1182-1226)
    * Gave everything away, ministering to lepers and poor
    * Insisted people devote themselves to ministry to the poor
    * It was said that he had reached a point where his union had already been initiated (moved passed purgation) because of the signs of the stigmata on his body
    * Argued that the individual Christian was to be devoted and committed to principle of absolute poverty
    * Some opposed this, eventually the Fransiscans split
    * Pope declared that not even Christ and the Apostles didn't practice rigorous absolute poverty, so not everyone had to
  * Dominique Guzman (1170-1221)
    * Spaniard who embraced principle of poverty as means to an end
    * Free people from the concerns of this world so that they may better serve the goals and the aims of the church
    * "Order of Preachers" - part of the task was the preservation of theological orthodoxy in the church
    * Should have an organization to educate preachers as students of theology and philosophy
      * To equip people to go out an refute heresy
      * Believed heresy much be confronted not simply by persecution but there should be an intellectual response as well
    * Developed a rigorous curriculum and training program (7 years)
    * Symbol was a dog with a lit torch in its mouth - "the hound of the Lord"
* How is it that so much theology is built on a pagan philosophy (Aristotle)?
  * Understands that God has revealed himself to us by giving us revelation - special and general - given in scripture and creation
  * Response to this is the task of theology - supernatural theology from special revelation and natural theology from general revelation
  * No such thing as a secular science of general revelation that can be investigated apart from God. Distinct from special revelation but still revealing God.
  * Need to explore rational capabilities, what it means to be made in the image of God
  * Can use this to understand special revelation
  * What about Aristotle?
    * As a result of general revelation, even with the tainting of sin, it is still possible to produce something that is accurate and useful
* Thomas Aquinas (1224-
  * Most significant scholastic theologian
  * Italian from wealthy aristocratic family, so he had a good education
  * Older brothers took part in the Crusade
  * Sisters became nuns
  * Went to a school run by Benedictine monks

  * Joined a monastic order, devoted to study of theology
    * Rose to be theologian and professor a University of Naples
      * Often considered leaving because the university opposed the Pope sometimes
      * Considered to be a scholar of Arabic language
      * Tried to understand Islamic theology
  * Eventually joined the Dominican order because he wanted to be a teacher and to defend the church
    * Devoted to poverty, remained til death
  * Sent to Paris after a while to study under Albert
    * Began to write and investigate theology that would become very influential
