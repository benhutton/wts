# Review

* Medieval theology is both positive and negative response to Augustine
  * City of God/City of Man distinction does NOT take hold in the Middle Ages
  * After empire breaks up, all the kings and princes are Christian and consider themselves to be protectors of the church
  * Rulers are scattered, no longer unified under one emperor, but will have the church as the unifying institution (though political division)
  * Thus magistrates see themselves as protectors and defenders of the Christian religion
  * Christendom continues (a Christian earthly kingdom)
  * Principle is that you had the same religion as your ruler
    * Rulers believed that God had chosen them to rule
    * Obviously not everyone was regenerate, but nobody would publically declare themselves to be not a Christian
    * Who is Aquinas trying to prove the existence of God too? What was his intent? In theory everyone was a theist.

# Practical

* What was the church like? What did it do? What were its emphases?
  * Patristic period hammered out major doctrines like the Trinity

* Emphasis on daily living as a Christian
  * Askew = asceticism - a desire to strengthen one's faith as you move through the Christian life
    * Moves out of an Augustinian framework 
      * Illumination -> Purgation (moral conversion) -> Union
      * Purgation = purging of things that keep you from devoting your life wholely to God - changing your life to follow the pattern of Christ
      * Union happens after death
      * Purgation period was entire Christian life
      * (Purgatory became a holding place where purgation could happen even after death)
      * Illumination is de-emphasized because everyone was assumed to be a Christian (since they've heard the Gospel from a very young age)
    * Strengthen yourself morally through the practice of self denial
      * Need to discipline self to deny things that keep you away from God
    * Fasting, renunciation of property and physical possessions, renounce marriage
    * Poverty, chastity, obedience is the higher form of the Christian life
    * Realized that not everyone can be so devoted, and not everyone has the same temptations that would distract them from God
    * Called these practices the "Councils of Perfection"
    * By 4th and 5th century, begin to see this especially in those who saw themselves as called to ministry
      * There are examples of 3rd century clergymen abstaining from marriage
    * Laity as early as 4th century began to live in monastic communities
      * Groups of individuals encouraging each other to live ascetic lives
      * Leaders of these groups became seen as "holy men" that lay people should go to for wisdom
    * Paintings from the period have vertical dimensional emphasis of people moving up to God
      * Also reports of monks seeing Aquinas levitating 3 feet off the ground
    * Discussions of illumination in terms of conversion and the gospel are de-emphasized because of over-emphasis of Purgation
    * Monastic communities emerged... to strengthen themselves through self denial
      * Early report of 300 monks walling themselves off for prayer + study + workshop work (cells, library, infirmary, workshop)
      * Needed money, so began to produce products that they could sell (furniture, beer)
      * Studied the Bible; became centers of learning
      * Served the development of medieval theology coming out of this period
    * Not everyone believed this was the best way to practice Christian life (Rulers + the wealthy)
      * Recognize that this is allowable but not essential
* Structure of worship in early medieval church
  * Prayer, scripture reading, sermon
  * Sometimes did this twice: prayer, scripture, sermon, prayer, scripture, sacrament
  * Emphasis NOT on singing - not a focal point or priority
  * Reading of Scripture and preaching followed electio continuum - straight through the Bible
  * 4th and 5th century discussion of what was going on when one takes the Lord's Supper
    * Is it really the case that the wine and bread in some supernatural way becomes the body and blood of Christ?
    * Some: when you come to the Lord's Supper, you receive the Body of Christ in some real way - not symbolic
    * Chrysostoam: memorial of sacrifice
    * Is it just a memorial, or is something really being communicated to us in a supernatural way?
* Prayer
  * Devotion to prayer was a major part of ascetic pattern
  * Who should prayers be directed towards?
    * Ultimately to God
  * As Christians we pray for one another. 
    * Does prayer cease with death? 
    * Can those that are dead pray for those that are alive? (becomes a thought in the 4th century)
  * Holy Relics became desired and venerated in the church
    * Christians begin to value the possessions of saints who died
    * Runs a bit against ascetic values
    * Originally were reminders of the dead saints' faith
    * Stories became circulated about relics (Constantine dreamed of the spear, found it and became emperor)
  * Saints who we remember through relics could be praying for us
  * Maybe we should then ask these saints to pray for us
  * Eventually develop a hierarchy of who might be closer to Christ - Mary would be the closest
    * Emphasis on Mary as intercessor arose - became chief mediator
  * By 5th century, theologians needed to clarify that asking saints for prayer is NOT a form of worship, as God alone is to be worshiped
    * How do you distinguish (since they look the same)?
    * 3 technical words:
      * douleia - serving, offered only to the saints
      * hupodouleia - higher veneration, offered to Mary
      * latria - the worship due to God and only God
  * All of this had some sort of Biblical root
  * At the lay level, this all didn't look any different - people couldn't functionally distinguish between praying to God and saints
    * Things are perceived differently by clergy and laity


* With rise of patriarchal churches came the rise of their bishops
  * Rome, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople
  * Offices/Titles
    * episcopas = bishop or senior pastor
    * presbuteras = presbyter or elder
    * diaconas = deacon
* Gregory the Great (540-604)
  * Known to be great pastor/administrator
  * Born to a wealthy, pious family in Rome
  * Gave away all his wealth at a very young age
  * Emphasized personal piety and the Lord's Supper
  * Had a traditional Roman education and regretted the fall of the Roman empire
  * Was elected bishop of Rome
  * By 4th and 5th century, bishop of Rome was asserting authority within the church
    * Called himself the "Universal Bishop" (ecumenical bishop) - head of the universal church
  * Gregory called himself the servant of the servants of God
    * Would not posture for power and authority
    * Saw his position as one of service
    * Lived consistent with this, with high moral standard in his life
  * Devoted himself to ministry and missionary work
    * Sent missionaries to barbarians attacking the borders of Roman Empire
  * Venerated Scripture, argued that the Bible was to be read by everyone
    * Latin, Coptic, Syriac translations from Greek and Hebrew
    * Jerome's Latin Vulgate was the standard
    * For now, everyone in the Empire could read Latin
    * After fall of Roman Empire, there would no longer be linguistic unity, though the Bible stayed in Latin
  * Emphasized Christ's death as a penalty, and his sacrifice as a pattern to be emulated
    * Saw himself as Augustinian, but described sin as the original condition and grace as man's antidote
    * Man was required to cooperate with the grace of God
    * "That which is a gift of the omnipotent God becomes our merit"
      * Doesn't put works over against grace
      * Somehow our merit is in cooperation with God's grace
      * Tries to follow Augistine, but ends up with semi-pelagian structure
      * Introduces a component of merit into salvation that he believes is compatible with the grace of God
  * Still have purgation - requires repentance - turning from sin and pursuing a righteous life
    * Repentance requires confession and demonstration
    * Demonstrate repentance through actions (penance)
  * Uses a strong allegorical hermeneutic to interpret Scripture
    * Book of Job: Job represents Christ, Job's wife represents the carnal human nature, Job's sons represent the apostles, Job's daughters represent 3 types of faithful lay people, Job's friends represent the heretics, 7000 sheep represent perfect Christians, 3000 camels represent heathens
  * Wrote "The Book of the Pastoral Rule" for instructing those training for ministry
    * Heavy emphasis on moral life
    * Must learn the art before you teach it
    * Need to address corruption of sin by studying Scripture
  * Wrote "The Dialogs" for lay people within the church
    * Wrote a dialog between Gregory and the apostle Peter
    * Taught that there would be a day - the judgment of God - when you will ultimately be purged -> purgation had an endpoint
      * Lacks specificity about how we get there
      * Is it possible that purgation extends into death, or union extends into life?
      * How long does purgation extend after death?
    * Why have so many truths about the life of the soul have been clarified for us in the last few years?
      * "It seems the spiritual world is moving towards us, manifesting itself in visions and revelations"
      * Seems like the world is coming to an end
      * Little distinction between secular and sacred
      * Little distinction between natural and supernatural 
        * Pre-Enlightenment, pre-Kant
        * Supernatural is not compartmentalized
        * Everyone (even muslims) had this worldview
        * What you do in this life (purgation) has absolute implications for what will happen in the afterlife
        * We have a lot to learn from this


  * Protestants would follow patristics, not gregory or any other popes

What about the heathen?

* Emphasis on Lord's Supper gave priestly function to pastors... so they eventually became called "priests"
