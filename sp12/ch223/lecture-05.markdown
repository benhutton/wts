3-5 page summary and interaction paper on Dr. Holloway's lectures, due last day of class

Describe some of the major controversies during the reign of Charlemagne

# Islam

* What is happening in the Islamic world and how it will impact the medieval church
* Five practices that Islam requires
  * Belief in one God with Mohammed as prophet
  * Pray five times a day
  * Give alms to the poor
  * Fasting during the month of Ramadan
  * Make a pilgrimage to Mecca during your lifetime
* When Mohammed died, bu Bakr is chosen as first Caliph (leader)
* Next Caliph is Umar ibn ul Khattab
  * Muslims conquered a wide range, Old Persia, North Africa, parts of Byzantine Empire
  * Devoted and committed to people - empire of peace, justice, dignity
  * Emphasized that those who converted would be considered equal
* Umayyad (661) - a Caliph and a school of thought within Islam
  * Damascus becomes capital of Islamic world
  * Conquer and stretch borders into China, Europe, Spain, Southern France
* Abbasids shifted capital to Baghdad, ruled for 500 years
  * Great military power and great emphasis on learning and libraries
  * Mongols conquered, but then converted to Islam
  * Western Europe turned attention and recognized that Islam had conquered traditionally Christian lands

# Within Christendom

* 1054 - pope tries to excommunicate Eastern church (sends Cardinal to Constantinople)
  * Excommunication excludes them from the church, damns them to hell
  * Considers the Bishop of Constantinople an unbeliever and outside of the church
* Schism divided Christendome and remains to today
* Had been power struggle as to which bishop has authority within the church (Roman bishop asserting himself over and over)
  * Bishop of Rome seemed to always be on the winning side of theological debates
* Specific issue has to do with modifying the Nicene Creed (which was a response to Arianism)
  * Son is eternally begotten of the Father - generated from the Father eternally
    * Jesus never had a beginning
    * But the Father begets the Son (and you can't reverse this order)
  * Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father - proceeded from the Father eternally
  * Arianism (Son was created) was still a problem in some place (like the East). If Spirit proceeds from Father and the Son, then Father and Son are equal
  * So they added term "filioque" = "and the Son"
    * Officially revised the creed to include this
    * Bishop of Constantinople responds: "How can you change a universal creed for the universal church without a universal council?"
    * This is the pope trying to assert authority over the Eastern church - doesn't believe he needs to consult a council
    * Bishop of Constantinople turned around and excommunicated the Pope
* Bishop of Antioch: For many years now, the western church has been divided from the other four patriarchs. So no Latin should be given communion unless he first separates from doctrines of the west.
  * They see themselves as the "Orthodox" church

# Crusades

* At best ephemeral, at worst tragic
* Ideal of the Crusade - spirit of enthusiasm and romanticism
* There was a desire that the Crusades would bring the two churches back together
* By 636, Muslim armies had marched...
* Jerusalem fell by 11th century
* Eastern church, seeing its territories were falling, begins to look for allies to help them
* 1095 - Pope Urban II: To the West, responding to Bishop of Constantinople, "Hasten to aid your brothers in the east"
  * In 1054, both had excommunicated each other
  * Now, asking for aid because of threat of Islam
  * Everyone should feel compelled as Christians to liberate lands that were Christian and aid the Christians
  * Makes it a requirement and says that "Christ commands it"
  * Way to respond is to take up the sword (not convert)
  * Gave all those that fought in Crusades immediate remission of sins
    * Shortcutting the process of illumination/purgation/union
    * Similar to jihad (how Islam advanced) - taking up the sword has spiritual benefits
    * Taking up the sword is a legitimate way to put down the enemies of God
* Many respond from England, France, Germany
  * Many different motives - from pious to opportunistic
* Multiple crusade - 4, 5, or 6 - in an attempt to support the Eastern Church and rid of the East of the Muslim threat
* First Crusade
  * Marched to Constantinople, received by Emperor
  * Took city of Nicaea back
  * Marched to Antioch, but failed there the first time
  * General given vision of the Lance that pierced Christ's side in the city of Antioch
    * Successful this time (after 5 days of fasting)
  * Turned attention to recapturing Jerusalem
    * June 7, 1099, reached Jerusalem
    * Sieged into July
    * Killed everyone in the city, religious cleansing
      * Raped women
      * Threw children against the walls
  * Set up puppet western rulers to reign in the conquered cities
    * Goal is to dominate and bring submission to the Eastern church and to place everything under the authority of the bishop of Rome
  * First Crusade was the most successful
* Later Crusades were not so successful
  * Difficulty in maintaining the Holy Land in terms of reinforcements and supplies
  * Couldn't defend and hold territories
  * Jerusalem fell to the Egyptian Sultan
* Second Crusade
  * Failed to retake Jerusalem
  * News shocked Christendem
* Third Crusade
  * Called for by Pope Gregory
  * Led by three major monarchs
    * Emperor Frederick of Germany
    * King Phillip III of France
    * King Richard the Lionhearted of England
  * Utter failure
    * Frederick drowned
    * Phillip left early, attacked English lands
    * Richard is attacked and held for ransom in Germany on his way to returning
* Fourth Crusade
  * 1204 - Pope Innocent II
  * Planned to strike at the heart of Egypt, which was sending the most armies
  * Diverted to support and save Constantinople from attack
    * Established a western emperor in Constantinople
    * New emperor declared that the church was now unified
    * Innocent declares that this is God's will
    * Byzantines in Constantinople then attack the Crusaders, and recapture Constantinople from western Crusaders
* Fifth Crusade
  * Another attempt at Jerusalem
  * Utter failure
  * West recognizes that it no longer has the ability to penetrate towards the East and rule the East
* By the end...
  * Continual rivalry between West and East
  * Islam firmly situated in the East
  * Western church in fear that Islam will march closer and closer to western cities
  * Failure forced Europe to pay attention to internal rivalries between monarchs
* Has implications for how we relate to Islam today
  * People from the outside and see this as part of our past
  * Islam expands by military conquest as well
