# Thomas Aquinas

## Scholasticism

* Widely considered to be the most significant and influential Scholastic
  * Represents the apogee - most sophisticated, nuanced, highly developed
* What is Scholasticism?
  * NOT to a school of philosophy or even to a set of beliefs
  * Refers to an intellectual method of inquiry and analysis
  * No universal agreement among scholastics about nature of a soul, principle of individuation, etc.
  * Possessed metaphysical and philosophical assumptions (about human reason) as presuppositions
  * End of 11th and beginning of 12th century
  * (John of Damascus in 8th century originated it in the East)
* Defining characteristic was argument
  * In contrast to contemplative, associative, literary character of monastic studies
  * Employed dialectical form of reasoning which raised questions, juxtaposed contradictory authorities, and tried to resolved contradictions with philology and formal logical analysis
  * Actively sought out areas of thought/points of difference where authorities would disagree
  * Endevoured to show that the contradictions were apparent rather than real (with reference to scripture)
  * Monastics had gravitated to bible commentaries, favored genre of "gloss" - commenting line by line on phrases and spiritual significance of text
  * Scholastics shifted away from biblical commentary and favored approach structured around a topic, with a series of questions exploring that topic
* By 13th century, scolastics wrote works in the form of "questiones"
  * Lists of questions on a certain topic of the Christian faith
  * Genre = "Summa"
    * Massive attempt to provide a systematic expression of Christian faith by putting together all the questiones that one might possibly conceive of, in a logical progression, then providing answers
    * Most famous was Aquinas' "Summa Theologiae"
* Can't ignore similarities with monasticism or exaggerate the novelty of scholasticism
  * Shared profound appreciation for the past, and in particular ancient texts
    * When scholastics were faced with philosophical or theological question, the first step/instinct was to look to the past
  * Agreed that faith was a necessary precondition for understanding
    * Anselm: Faith seeking understanding
    * Acceptable to many scholastic thinkers
    * Not everyone agreed on this (such as Aquinas)
    * Augustine: I believe in order to understand
* "Metalogicon" - John of Salisbury - We are like dwarves who can see far because we are carried by the giants of the past

* Peter Abelard (1079-1142)
  * Leading scholastic of 12th century
  * Sic et non (Yes and no) - most famous work
    * Showed how biblical and patristic passages apparently contradict each other
    * Pressing his readers to use their reasoning abilities to resolve their apparent contradictions
    * Abelard himself did not attempt to resolve the contradictions
    * Interpretation that he was attempting to undermine the Christian faith was mistaken
  * This method shaped Aquinas' training and informed his output

* Aquinas was not regarded as preeminent during his own lifetime
  * Merely one of a number of important intellectuals
  * Would never have guessed he would have achieved the renown he has
  * WT Jones in "The Medieval Mind" - Intellect was same rank as Plato/Aristotle, stands functionally to Middle Ages as Plato/Aristotle does to classical world
  * Bertrand Russell - living influence greater than Kant or Hegel
  * In terms of western intellectual tradition, deserves a place with Plato, Aristotle, Augustine

## Aquinas' Life

* Born in Italy
  * Entered abbey at age 5; Benedictine Order

## Intellectual Context

* 3 factors that contributed to intellectual life in the 13th century
  * Emergence of a confused Aristotelianism
    * West lost a lot of Plato and Aristotle writings
    * During early middle ages, western europe lost many texts - "Dark Ages"
    * Exception was Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain)
      * Most economically advanced part of Europe
      * Collected large numbers of Greek and Arabic manuscripts (esp. math and astronomy)
    * Ideas of Plotinus confused with Aristotle
      * Section of "Aeneides" circulated under the title "The Theology of Aristotle"
    * Neoplatonic character of Islamic philosophy
    * During the 13th century, recovered a confused "Aristotelianism"
    * Works of Aristotle became basic texts for "Lectio"
      * Students were trained for 6 years in the thought of Aristotle ("The Philosopher")
      * Averroes = "The Commentator"
    * Scholastic theoretical discussion was through an Aristotelian framework through an Islamic commentator
    * Study of "Aristotle" spread rapidly through universities during 13th century
    * March 19, 1255 - writings of Aristotle officially approved at University of Paris
      * ALL works were to be included
  * Development of the university
    * Before universities, most formal education took place at monasteries or individual schools ("The School of Peter Abelard") or cathedral schools
    * With rise of universities, loosening of Church's influence on education
    * After 1260, study of philosophy became independent of theology (for faculty of Arts at University of Paris)
    * Siger Brabant lead group of masters to defend separate of philosophy
      * Bishop of Paris condemned some theses/treatises
      * In response to first controversy over the eternality of the world, Aquinas wrote
      * Aquinas is writing major works to address controversies
    * Beginning of 13th century, Bologna + Paris
    * End of 13th century, had about 20
    * University of Paris was earliest and greatest university
      * Known for its study of theology
      * Run by masters
      * Masters were paid by church 
    * University of Bologna
      * Run by students
      * Masters paid by students
    * Aquinas and Bonaventure taught at Paris as masters
    * Universities functioned like guilds
      * Masters and students would join together to protect and further their own interests
      * Higher education was institutionalized
      * Tied to fixed forms
      * Established a curriculum, tasks of masters, requirements for degrees
    * Method of teaching was "Lectio" - exposition of a text
      * First task of a master was to read and exposit the authoritative text prescribed by university
      * Second task was to hold disputations/"disputatio" (Aquinas held them every 2 weeks)
      * Day after, conducted "determinatio"/resolution
        * Would weight arguments, resolve things
      * Disputatio + determinatio = genre of "Questiones Disputatai"
      * Left its mark on the philosophical treatises of the century
      * Distinctive use of philosophy in resolving theological questions
    * Student had to first learn Bachelor of Arts curriculum
      * Then Master of Theology
      * Had to do lecture on Sentences of Peter Lombard
  * Rise of religious orders
    * Pope gave Francis of Assissi to found order of fratres menores
      * Primarily Augustinian, with some Aristotelian influences
      * Major Franciscan that concerns us is Bonaventure
    * Dominican order, founded by Guzman, was to be an order of preachers
      * Primarily Aristotelian, with minor influences of Augustinianism and Neoplatanism
    * Aristotle was translated from Greek to Arabic to Latin
    * Beginning of 13th century, church became convinced the Christian Aristotelianism was heretical
      * Church sought to ban influences of its teaching... 2 beliefs were problematic
        * Natural philosophy (1210, provincial council of paris)
          * Pope forbade teaching of certain books at the University of Paris, though that didn't stop anything
          * Metaphysics of Aristotle was also banned
          * 1230s, pope wanted Aristotle edited/redacted to become more acceptable
          * 1277, most spectacular of these condemnations - bishop of paris, condemned 219 articles from aristotle, averroes, scholastics (including aquinas)
          * 1278, Dominicans officially accepted Thomism
          * In 16th century, declared the Thomas ranked equally with Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory
    * Averroes taught that there were 2 philosophical doctrines as part of Aristotle
      * First, denial of creation
        * Aristotle did teach that the universe was eternal
        * Still confused Aristotle and Plotinas
        * Wrote of the origin of the world in the way that Plotinas did - an emanation or overflow of the being of God
        * Plotinas: God = overflow of the plenitude of being; world emanates from God
      * Second, denial of personal immortality
        * Plotinas - one cosmic nous, when someone died they were reabsorbed into the cosmic nous
      * Both are obviously incompatible with historical Christianity AND Islamic orthodoxy
    * Averroes developed his "Double Truth Theory"
      * Influenced the "Latin Averroists" at the University of Paris, led by Siger Brabant
        * Accepted Aristotle as true, even though they recognized the contradiction with Christianity
        * Denied creation and personal immortality
      * What was thought to be Aristotle's "Natural Philosophy" was banned
      * Siger would affirm the double truth theory: philosophically the world is eternal, but theologically the world is created

## Metaphysics

* Aquinas wanted to rescue Aristotle for Christian philosophy
  * Had to eliminate all the problems and challenges that confronted him
  * Basic outlines of his metaphysic are Aristotelian
    * Universe = collection of individual substances defined in terms of matter and form
    * Created world is not a shadow (as Plato said)
    * Creator + creatures form one universe, a single continuous hierarchy
    * Universe is a hierarchy of substances, God is the summit of that hierarchy of substances
      * God is pure actuality, activity, intelligence
      * God's perfection inspires the universe's movement
  * There were deeper truths about the divine nature that were inaccessible to Aristotle
    * What Aristotle does say about God is true
* Summa Theologiae
  * Huge, logically organized structure of propositions
  * Can be taken as a reflection, at the level of thought, of the structured ordered hierarchy of matter and form
  * Through the use of mans natural, unaided reason, Aquinas sought to demonstrate:
    * That God is not bodily
    * That God is not material
    * That God is not a compound
    * That God is his own essence
    * That God is perfect
    * That God is good
    * That God is intelligent
    * That God is volitional
    * That God is the creator
    * That God is providential
  * For Thomas, physics was an appendage to theology - goal was to provide an adequate interpretation of the account of creation as set forth in the book of Genesis and to reconcile Aristotle's physics
    * The first rule is to hold the truth of scripture without wavering, since scripture has more authority than the human intellect, we cannot for a moment doubt that the waters are where it says they are
  * Everything seeks God
    * How can sin and error be accounted for if everything seeks God?
    * Not everything seeks God directly
    * Most things know God so inadequately that they take certain subordinate goods as their inordinate ends (stone's end is the center of the earth)
  * The place of each substance is determined by its degree of actuality
    * At the bottom of the hierarchy, being and reality fade into nothingness (and the mere possiblility of being something)
    * At the top of the hierarchy is God
    * Everything has within it a drive to become fully and actually what it might be
    * All movement and change is a coming to be, a fulfillment of something's nature
    * Had a teliological/purposive view of nature
    * Universe has a vast teliological structure - all things aim at ends
    * To understand behavior, ask "to what is it moving?"
      * Thus, all of the other sciences pass into theology (because everything is always ultimately moving towards God)
      * And theology becomes known as the "Queen of the Sciences"
    * Material substances occupy lower levels of hierarchy
    * Angelic substances occupy higher levels of hierarchy
      * Immediately under God
      * Devoted a large part of Summa to account of nature and attributes of angels
      * Has been suggested that there must be a whole series of beings between God and man
      * If angels are incorporeal and so lack matter, it seems to follow that they are fully actualized and so indistinguishable from God
        * How do you distinguish God from angels?
        * Bonaventure argued that angels, like men, had form and matter
        * Aquinas argued that angels had higher intelligences - independent of sense experience for knowledge of form - thus cannot have a body with senses
          * Introduced a distinction between the potentiality of matter and potentiality of intellect
          * Angels have potentiality of intellect, which preserves the suppremacy of God and distinguishes angels from him
        * Only one of each species of angels (matter is what distinguishes members of a class/individuals of the same species)
          * Angels have no matter, so can differ only formally
          * Species exist in extremely great number
          * The more perfect some things are, the greater the number created by God
        * Three main groups
          * Seraphim
          * Cherubim
          * Thrones
          * Dominions
          * Virtues
          * Powers
          * Principalities
          * Archangels
          * Mere Angels
        * Differ in their degree of adequacy in their knowledge of God

## Epistemology

* Rejected the view that human beings possess innate knowledge
* Basis of human knowledge is sense experience
* Was an empiricist in epistemology
* Systematic knowledge extends only as far as sensory cognition
* Nothing in the intellect that is not first in the senses
  * Nihil in intellectu quot non prius in sensu
* Rejects notion that humans possess innate ideas
* NOT that the sense are total cause of all of our knowledge, but they provide the material from which the intellect abstracts the intelligible content
* Intellect determins the universal forms by extracting the universals embedded in particulars
* If all knowledge begins with sensation, then how do we know God?
  * Causality
  * Remotion
  * Immanence
