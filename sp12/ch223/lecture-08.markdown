# Thomas Aquinas

* Most significant scholastic theologian
* Italian from wealthy aristocratic family, so he had a good education
* Older brothers took part in the Crusade
* Sisters became nuns
* Went to a school run by Benedictine monks
  * Devoted himself to study of Latin, Patristic and Biblical studies
* Joined a monastic order, devoted to study of theology
  * Rose to be theologian and professor a University of Naples
    * Often considered leaving because the university opposed the Pope sometimes
    * Considered to be a scholar of Arabic language
    * Tried to understand Islamic theology
    * Focused studies on Augustine and how Islamic scholars used Aristotle
* By 1242, joined the Dominican order because he wanted to be a teacher and to defend the church
  * "Better to give results of one's contemplation to others"
  * Devoted to poverty, remained til death
* Sent to Paris to study at the university there under Albert
  * Began to write and investigate theology that would become very influential
* Sent to Colombe to establish Dominican college there
  * Worked as Albert's assistant, began to transcribe Albert's lectures
* Returned to Paris, lectured himself
  * Taught Peter Lombard's Sentences
  * Political tensions - administrators and secular masters suspected the Dominicans
  * Dominican mendicants are seen as the new direction of the church
  * Kicked out... returns eventually
* Produces commentary on Sentences; cites Aristotle more than 2000 times
* 1252 - the university is given authorization to teach out of Aristotle's texts
  * Begins to integrate Aristotle into his theology
  * Probably attempting to refute Islamic theology, which had been using Aristotle
  * Trying to reclaim Aristotle into the Christian tradition
  * Didn't want to let Islam win via philosophy what it failed to win via military
* 1256 - appointed to principal divinity chair in Paris (full professor)
  * Given the honor and privilege of teaching from Scripture itself
    * Philosophical influence by Aristotle
* Began Summa Theological and Summa Contra Gentiles
* 1259 - returns to Naples
* 1268 - returns to Paris to lecture and teach
* 1272 - University of Paris shut down again; returns to Naples and has 12/6/1273 mystical experience... ceased to write any more theology
* 1274 - Set out to attend Council of Lyon; diverted; stayed with nieces; died
* Opinions of theological contribution
  * "Never an aloof academic... he was involved in the controversies, but trusted as an administrator by the friars that knew him best... also consulted by more than one Pope"
    * Was well placed
  * "Misleading to regard him as a Christian Aristotelian... need to acknowledge his indebtedness to the Fathers and to Scripture"
  * "Suspected to concede too much to Greek philosophy... bishop condemned radical Aristotelianism, but he was allowed to remain"
* What was his theology? What was his basic foundation point?
  * Anthropology - doctrine of man
    * What is man? What constitutes a human being?
    * God created each human being, and constituted that human being with two components
      * Reason/Mind = higher self
      * Flesh/Pleasures/Desires = lower self
    * There is naturally a tension in which your fleshly desires are in tension with your proper reason
      * "Concupiscence"
    * Image of God = gift of grace from God to humanity, "super-added gift of grace"
      * Keeps the lower desires in check and allows him to function with the proper reason that God has given him
    * The Fall happened, Adam sinned, hat falls off - "super-added gift of grace" is removed, desires are not in check, so now they cause you to sin
      * Not sure why sinned first happened
    * After the Fall, reason is intact; you just don't always follow it because of lower fleshly desires. But it is still possible to think rightly
      * Mind is still okay, but desires corrupt it. Locus of problem is in the flesh. Nothing wrong with the mind in and of itself.
    * Nature/Grace dualism
    * Augustinian, not semi-pelagian - no one lives up to the standards of God after the Fall, God has elected, can't know who the elect are. Therefore, can't relate Christian experience to the doctrine of election
  * Work of Christ as it relates to salvation and anthropology
    * Christ came to redeem, as a sacrifice of the lost
    * Did what we could not do, paying the penalty for sin and earning the merit required to fulfill God's salvation
    * Merit of Christ's work is now available to those who would come to Christ
    * What you need is this merit. Provides the antidote to the loss of the "super-added gift of grace"
      * Corrects what happened in the Fall
      * What was lost in Adam is now recovered in Christ
    * How does one come to this grace?
      * How is one justified?
      * By faith (but not alone)
      * For Aquinas, faith is information, data, that which is understood intellectually
      * Faith presents the intellect with knowledge
      * Need a faith that is appropriately formed by love
        * "Love is the form of faith. We are saved by faith formed by love."
      * Love is a gift of God
      * How much love does one need?
        * Talking about this in a quantifiable form
        * Work in the believer who continues to grow in the knowledge presented
      * Grace is quantifiable too... and the deposit of grace is in the church
        * The church is the deposit of the merit of Christ, which is the grace that you need to correct the problem of the Fall and the loss of the super-added gift of grace
        * Grace is in the sacraments
      * Spells out 7 sacraments - points in which this grace is dispensed to you
        * Baptism
        * Confirmation
        * Communion
        * Marriage
        * Holy Orders
        * Penance
        * Last Rites/Extreme Unction
      * Preaching is NOT a sacrament
      * Communion and penance are the two sacraments that are ongoing (happen more than once in a person's life)
        * Need grace dispensed through sacraments to grow in grace
        * Focal points of sacramental system
        * Sliding scale - grow or fall - need grace to correct the falls
      * Salvation is now solely within the church
        * Whoever controls the sacraments holds eternal destiny in your hands
        * Church can wield great power because of this
      * Implicit faith = trust that the church has the true knowledge... this is enough; doesn't matter if you're not so smart
    * "Is the love by which we are saved a created habit in our soul, or is it the very person of the HS dwelling within us?" - Lombard
      * Presupposes that we are saved by loved, and being changed by love to be acceptable to God
      * Asks the nature of the love - HS indwelling us or changing us
      * Habit = characteristic or ability within an individual
      * When God looks at us and judges us, does he see us as the HS, or as changed by the HS
      * Aquinas - sees love as a habit within us
        * God judges you NOT according to what he sees in somebody else, but what he sees in you
    * Who can receive the sacraments?
      * Protestants = Christians
      * Aquinas = all; faith is not precondition of receiving grace
    * Impacts
      * Centralizing authority
      * Emphasis on preaching diminished, because it is not saving people
      * Question of assurance - can never know for sure that you are saved
      * "Do your best and God will not deny you"
    * Enters the debate about what is happening in the Lord's Supper
      * Substantial transformation - physical presence of Christ in the sacraments
      * Aristotle was helpful here
        * Everything had substance and accidents
          * Substance - its a chair
          * Accidents - its made out of metal, with green vinyl covering
        * Can change the accidents and the substance can stay the same
      * In the miracle of the Lord's Supper, the substance changes and the accidents stay the same
      * How can one body be everywhere and every time?
        * Christ is God and man, so flesh becomes omnipresent
      * Perpetual sacrifice
      * Everything done in Latin - not the common language of the people
      * Once transubstantiated, elements don't go back... can't throw them out, need to keep them
  * Covenant and the aspect of merit within the covenant
    * Relationship between God and man, and how is this understood wrt what is earned and what is rewarded?
    * 2 ways to talk about merit
      * Condign - presupposes an equality between service and return
        * The work that you do deserves (or has the value) of what is given as a payment or a reward
      * Congruent - presupposes an inequality, a lack of intrinsic proportion between the service and payment
        * Whatever work you're doing is not enough to deserve the payment
        * Reward is given on the grounds of generousity of the one giving it
        * Kind of a "half-merit"
    * Relationship between God and man? - There is the greatest inequality
      * Can be no justice of equality, but only in a certain proportion
      * Man's merit with God only exists on the presupposition of divine ordination
      * God created us in ways that you can do "something"
      * We cannot claim condign merit
    * How do we understand merit and covenant in pre-fall and post-fall states?
      * Pre-fall state
        * God preordains all things
        * Merit depends on what God has divinely ordained
        * God has given Adam a proportion of power - has a particular ability, can act according to natural power
        * Everlasting life is a good exceeding the proportion of the created nature
        * No created nature is a sufficient principle of an act meritorious of eternal life, unless there is added a supernatural gift which we call grace
        * In natural state, Adam could never earn eternal life
        * Merit is always ours (no imputation)
      * Post-fall state
        * Adam sins, super-added gift of grace lost
        * What impedes man's merit? Sin
          * Sin is an offense against God, excluding us from eternal life
        * Need grace in which sin is forgiven
        * This then moves us into a position in which we are able to have eternal life
          * Grace gives you what you need to begin to have a degree of merit
        * There is no condign merit
        * We cannot merit eternal life because of our actions (without grace)
        * When grace comes to you through sacramental system...
          * Grace through HS is meritorious of eternal life condignly
        * In the grace given by the HS, there is something there that is condign - worthy in terms of reward of the work that is required
          * Initial grace - no one can merit for himself the first grace; Augustinian - God draws people to himself
          * Ongoing grace - once you receive initial grace, you're in the sacramental system, receiving grace; because of the work of the HS in the sacraments, the merit that follows from this grace is condign (because it is enveloped in the work of the HS)
            * Still your merit; gets value because of the HS
            * The more you do it, the better
        * Must continue to access this grace, and it will in fact transform/change/renovate you (you are actually changing, becoming someone who loves God more)
        * How much is enough? "Do your best and God will not deny you"
    * Turretin - how do we engage the relationship between God and man in covenant, and what is the place of merit?
      * It isn't necessary for God to enter covenant with man - no requirement within creation or within man.
        * It is entirely something God freely chooses to do - he condescends
        * No way does creation demand a covenantal relationship
        * God chooses to
        * No condign merit
      * Once God creates man...
        * Without covenant, by virtue of being a creature, Adam owes obedience to God (even without reward)
        * Adam created perfect, holy, and righteous, has every ability in created state to complete his part of the Covenant of Works - does not need super-added grace
        * What if Adam had not fallen, and completed the terms of the covenant? Would merit at this point be congruent or condign?
          * Trick question
          * Covenant doesn't need to happen - not condign
          * But Adam has power within himself to be obedient to God, earn the terms of the covenant, be meritorious
          * Would Adam say to God, "I did it - pay up!" No... he would say, "be faithful to your promises"
            * God has a "debt of faith" - faithfulness to his promises
          * Condign = merit does it
          * Congruent = God enters into covenant and is faithful
* Aquinas' theology becomes confessionalized
  * Particularly understanding of salvation and sacraments
  * Becomes official position of RC church at Council of Trent
  * Are Catholics Christian?
    * Probably are some
    * But at the official level, they don't understand the true Gospel
