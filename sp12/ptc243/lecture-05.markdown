# Blind Men & The Elephant

* Often used in intro psych chapters to talk about "who's right" about what is a human being

* Church 30 paces away knows its an elephant
* Scientist studying the "tree" sees folds, bugs, hairs, blood, etc. that we didn't see
  * Willing to recognize that his theory has some trouble accounting for certain dynamics
    * Sap pulses when stabbed
    * Trees move around
    * Trees come in fours and die in fours

* 6 wisdoms
  * Need to know model - need to know its an elephant
  * Worth paying attention to contemporary theories - interesting details yet completely false
    * Theory is seductive and persuasive - accounts for facts that church hasn't talked about
    * Common grace and antithesis don't flatten each other out, but liberate each other to run wild - happen at exactly the same time
  * "What is...." profusion
    * They see facts
    * They ask questions
    * They care about important things
  * How do you understand? Interpretive
  * How do you fix it? Intervention
    * What do they do most skillfully?
    * What do they accomplish that is helpful?
    * What personal qualities seem admirable?
      * Self-checking
  * We can see more facts (no blinkering)
  * We can explain facts and counterfacts
  * We should far exceed interventions/ministries

* Heresies are the natural result of the debts of the church
  * Lack of pastoral counseling -> psychiatry
  * Lack of real eschatology -> Jehovah's Witnesses

# Multiple Intelligences - Howard Gardner

* What is the fundamental theological truth that Gardner is flirting with?
* What is the core Biblical reality about people that is pressing in on Gardner, whether he knows it or not?
  * Creation - God who is hands-on creating but he doesn't want to go there
* What is the fundamental biblical reality that makes Gardner nix the idea that there is a spiritual intelligence?
  * Godward/meaning/moral/covenantal doesn't reduce to the biological
* For Gardner, figuring out biological basis for intelligence wasn't enough for him
  * Love neighbor = moral
  * Ethical orientation -> vocation/calling/mission
  * Sees Fall in need of Redemption
  * Education + communities
* Leading edge of theory, Creation is pressing in
* Gets interested in bigger issues (how do you create good people?) because he has a salvation project

* Realities of Christian faith describes what's going on so well

* There is such a thing as moral intelligence - we call it wisdom and it is the ability to choose between good and evil

* What fundamental biblical and theological reality compels Gardner to systematically repress the signs of creation, fall, and redemption that can be seen and heard in all the facts that most interest him?
  * Romans 1 - suppresses the truth
  * If you are suppressing God, you suppress the knowledge of what a person is
  * Humans can only be comprehended in their glory and their tragedy

  * We have self-serving motives and self-esteem motivation powers it
  * "Why" question is the theoretical core
* Self-serving bias as adaptive
  * Positive self-esteem buffers anxiety, including anxiety related to our certain death
  * Psalm 90 says to look at mortality in the eye and look at wrath and number days to gain wisdom
    * Confront fragility, which is a result of the God who will destroy us because of our iniquity
    * "Teach us to number our days so that we can gain a heart of wisdom" is the change in the tidal drift from minor key to major key Psalms
* The perils of pride and the power of positive thinking

# Self-esteem

* Central to David Burns, Freud, etc.
* Term does not appear in Scripture
  * Covers the turf of identity or self-knowledge
  * OT: "In the eyes of", NT: "Conscience"
    * "They did what was right in their own eyes"
    * Part of the image of God
    * Evaluative capacity as human beings
    * We evaluate everything - food, weather, selves, God, public speakers
    * God evaluates everything
* Not all self words are created equal
  * Some are almost unredeemable (honor words - point to God or come from God - good and bad)
    * self-esteem (esteem is worship language)
    * self-worth (literally worship language)
    * self-love (also has worship connotations)
    * self-efficacy (power, strength, competence, sufficiency)
    * self-confidence
    * self-affirmation
    * self-acceptance
    * self-validation
  * Make a good move in the right direction (picture words)
    * self-concept - how you conceive of your identity
      * Has a potentially bad connotative drift
    * self-image
      * Even stronger bad connotative drift
  * Even better (picture + evaluation words, true and false, accurate and inaccurate)
    * self-knowledge
    * self-understanding
    * self-estimation (close to esteem, but not a value sense)
    * self-evaluation
* Goal is not good/secure self-esteem, but a clear sense of who you are
* What standard am I evaluating myself by? (true standard or false standard)
  * Standards can be ladders or spectrums
    * Ladder - defines identity?
      * Ladders to nowhere
    * Spectrum - human difference in the world?
      * Before God, things are differences
    * Do we take differences and erect them into a ladder
  * Types of ladders/spectrums
    * Wealth
    * Achievements
    * What people think of you
    * Physical appearance
  * There is a standard - God's standard
    * 10 commandments
      * Vertical - love for God, trust
      * Horizontal - general righteousness, wisdom, redemptive image of Jesus (Exodus 34:6-7), love for others
    * Psalmic faith
      * Awareness of godlessness
      * Turns to the God of mercy
      * Vulnerability
      * Takes refuge
      * Joy
    * Ephesians has 30-40 identity statements that form the basis of your self-knowledge/self-understanding
      * God-referential
      * You are a "we" - corporate component
* Whose standard?
  * Whose eyes matter? (true eyes or false eyes)
  * 3 options
    * Your own eyes - pride
    * Others' eyes - fear of man
    * Him with whom we have to do - God's eyes matter
  * Conscience, self-evaluation, identity
    * First, from God's eyes
    * Second, own eyes - having realistic evaluation is very important
    * Also second, others' evaluation is important (finding calling, reputation with outsiders, etc.)
* How do we understand the experience of a conscience that at times condemns us and at other times commends us?
  * Can feel good because:
    * Follow true standard: pay taxes
    * Under true eyes: God says to honor government
    * Follow false standard: make the $100000
    * Under false eyes: I think I need to make the $100000
  * Can feel bad because:
    * False standard, eyes are true: Failure to have 3hr quiet time every day
  * Explains "guilty feelings" and "false guilt"
    * Secular culture tries to erase this
    * Ministry should renew the standard and renew the eye (really guilty of wrong standard and wrong eyes)
* What is the source of justification?
  * Performance + reputation?
  * Gospel?
* Goal is accurate self concept and true self knowledge
  * Calvin: to know God is to know myself, to know myself is to know God
* Different types of consciences
  * Morally crazed upside down
  * Overscrupulous
  * Seared/calloused
  * Overly self confident
  * Accusatory, morbid, self-condemning

Common grace + antithesis wrt conscience
What is the conscience?
