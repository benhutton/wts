# Adonis Complex

* We find out the great story through a thousand tiny stories
* "You are called to trust God about everything in life...." about 500 different ways, never boilerplate
* Any sin is OCD (good to know the language the culture uses)
* USA Today article got deeper from a certain point of view than Pope - the guy wanted to have girls like him
* Maximally get on the ground of the discussion - giving lots of different interpretations helps
* Where is the line between good and evil? How does one tell when a good thing becomes a monster? When it is close to becoming a monster? When its just a good thing?

* Who is the audience? People who want to help people and take the Bible seriously
* People who take scripture seriously have one of two problems:
  * Hyper-relevant Bible - need a prooftext for everything
  * Under-relevant Bible - no verse, so go to the secular expert
  * Both have a prooftexting hermeneutic - one finds too much, and one finds too little
* Detailed case study: Want to know Darnell better than he does
  * Want to give audience facts
    * Benefits of reading history and fiction
* Why pick focusing on behavior, motive, and influences from the surrounding world?
  * Gets onto Pope's ground and speaks in his categories
  * Point of contact was NOT the view of the Bible, or does God exist?
  * Not about epistemology

# Intro to Personality Theory

* Start with naive observation about what people do (as if we were Martians)
  * "All of science is nothing more than an extension of every day observation" - Einstein

Guilt

The Bible is a text that resists reduction to the psychological.

Maslow: The original criteria of motivation, and one still used, is the subjective one. "I am motivated when I feel ____________." 

Cornerstone of every theory is how it answers the "why?" question.

Listing is easy. Key is what framework you put it in. How you put it all together.

5 Families of theories

1. Building block theory (drives) - some things are fundamental/underlying, and everything else builds on top of it. Underlying are the organismic drives (1, 2), other motives are means to an end (3-7). 1st and 2nd degree drives. How we are like animals. Behaviorism. Action is heading towards the fundamentals. Fundamentals are givens, everything else is learned.
2. Conflict theory (instincts) - (1,2) are in fierce competition with (4,5). Freud: conflict between "id" and forces of socialization/"super-ego". Man who would have an affair and cheat on his taxes, but wouldn't shoplift a candy bar (because it would get in the papers). Conflict between desire and conscience.
3. Hierarchy theory (needs) - (1,2) / (4) / (5, 6) / (7) - driving toward the top (self-actualization)
4. "yellow-highlighter" - gives up on being a grand unifying theory of everything, focuses on one thing. 
  * Adler: drive to compensate for inferiority and weakness (5, 6). 
  * Existentialists: search for meaning (7). 
  * Marxist: singled out money and power (3, 5).
  * Medical/biological reductionism (1, 2). You're just a body - we don't need to be bothered with the psychological complexity.
  * McClellan/Glasser: affiliation and achievement, need for love and achievement (4, 6). Larry Crabb is this (needs for relationship and impact).
5. "box of legos" - whole bunch of factors, don't try to sort it out into any system (atheoretical). Just deal with what people are driven by.

Theories keep mutually self-destructing each other in terms of plausibility.
Christianity is the only plausible and sustainable TOE that can make sense of people and their desires. Christian faith assembles the legos into something adaptable, workable, able to explain each of the others.

## How does scripture interplay with all of this?

* Does the Bible acknowledge that people are motivated by these things?
  * Yes; data is everywhere, never systematized
  * Bible doesn't intend to provide an exhaustive catalog
  * Bible never singles out any one of these as decisive  (what about money?)

1. Basic bodily needs - Matthew 6:31-34 - "Don't be anxious about what you should eat, what you should drink, what you should wear. The Gentiles seek after all these things"
2. Sex - 1 Thessalonians 4:5 - Talks about taking one's sexual partner in passionate lust like the Gentiles
3. Money - Luke 16:13-14 - Talks about serving money and loving money
4. Social connectedness - John 12:42f - People who wouldn't confess Christ because they don't want to be thrown out of the synagogue
5. Social order - Luke 22:24-27 - Disciples arguing about who would be greatest. Kings of gentiles exercise lordship and authority. 
6. Competition - Jeremiah 9:23 - People who boast in their wisdom, might, achievement
7. Identity/Meaning - Luke 9:23-26 - Saving your life, finding your life, gaining the whole world; Ecclesiastes is a meditation on where people find meaning

There is an objective givenness to the Bible's accepting that people are motivated with all these

Does God have a motivation theory? Is it similar to one of the other theories in its fundamental structure, yet Christified?
