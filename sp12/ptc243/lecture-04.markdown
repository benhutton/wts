# Six Kinds Of Wisdom

* Apologetically reinterpreting and engaging

1. Knowing your own model
  * The ability to work out of a biblical framework
  * The way you think, and the way you live your life
  * Being able to think and process life from the inner logic of a Christian understanding of reality
  * Combines commitment with teachability
    * The most firm and the most flexible

2. Know other points of view/models
  * Think from within another framework
  * Place the data in a different framework and understand the logic on its own terms
  * A matter of intellectual and pastoral integrity
    * Other person should say, "We disagree, but you haven't caricatured me"
  * Issue of courtesy and respect
    * Don't caricature or globalize
  * Lends persuasion
  * How much do we need to know?
    * Need to know what's significant for the people that we're working with (might need to go read some Dr. Phil)

** What about splitting? Recognizing the good will help people that aren't so good at splitting

* Van Til: everyone has same info; we disagree about how to interpret that info
  * Need a presuppositional apologetic

3. Analytic

            Information


  Interpretation       Intervention


  * Information ("science" - what is?)
    * Need to engage a theory at its strong points, not weak points
      * At their best, you turn their whole world upside down
      * Otherwise, my best against your worst 
    * Four questions
      a.) What do they see most clearly? (Description/observation)
      b.) What do they care about most deeply?
        * Not just facts, but people care about facts that are meaningful to them - things that are destructive
      c.) What questions are they seeking to pose most profoundly?
        * Why do people do what they do?
      d.) What connections do they note most perceptively?
  * Interpretation ("theology" or "worldview" - how do we understand?)
    * No such thing as a brute fact - we always have a meaning framework
    * Butterfield: relationship between a bundle of data and the framework in which it is put
    * How do you explain what you know?
    * Has a number of direct effects even on what you see
      * Focusing/magnifying - helps you see things that you wouldn't otherwise see, generates new information
        * The theory that abuse lies behind all problems has people looking for more and more ways in which people mistreat each other
      * Blinkering - makes it not see other things
        * In class brainstorming on desires overcame blinkering
        * Abuse theory works when you have abused screwed up people and unabused successful people
          * Doesn't work when you have abused successful people and unabused screwed up people
        * Way more going on in reality than the theory explains
          * Theory isn't explaining life but only the easy cases
      * In principle, a Christian interpretation should be able to account for everything
      * Comprehensive distortion - ends up getting the whole world wrong
  * Intervention ("Practical theology" - what do we do about it?)
    * Explanations are sign posts to solutions
    * 

    Possible interventions drive observations and interpretations?

4. How is what I'm engaging persuasive and perverse?
  * Discernment, alertness
  * Aware that theories are loaded
  * Aware that even with "science", author has a conversional mission
  * Disinformation - things that are true that lead you away from the truth
  * Antithesis

5. Where is this informative and provocative?
  * Where are there things I've never thought about before?
  * Where are there questions I've never tackled before?
  * Where are there things that understood rightly would enrich biblical worldview?
  * Teachability
  * Common grace
  * Interaction between antithesis and common grace is important for making sense of the world
    * The intertwine in the same things
  * Biblical counseling often misses this, becomes insular and triumphalistic
  * If this is all you do, you'll become a syncretist and compromise
    * Much of the Christian psychotherapy (integrationists)
  * Chesterton: Christian faith lets seemingly paradoxical things both run wild

6. Communicate constructively - Reinterpretive engagement 
  * Gentle in manner, firm in matter - Van Til

* Where's the fatal flaw, the internal contradiction
  * Real reality is God-centered
  * Facts all speak of the God who made the world and is king over all
  * Often flaw is leaving out really important facts - the pressure of reality destroys theories
  * Anomolies destroy interpretations; failures destroy interventions

# Five Stages of Grief Case Study

blinkering - privitization

* Our observations
  * Shock/denial
  * Community effect
  * Vertical/prayer/trust
  * Horizontal/reconciliation
  * Redemption/joy/rejoicing/grace to get through
  * Information gathering
  * Help seeking
  * Exploration of own mortality
  * Overwhelming loss/tears/felt pain
  * Fear/anger/stress/desires/sorrow
  * Repentance for asociality
  * Looking for explanation of the afterlife
  * Guilt/why not me/regrets
  * Relief
  * Practical life learning
  * Step in with love
  * Jacob - life-long sorrow
  * Moral outrage
  * Bargaining
  * Depression
  * Acceptance
  * Self-hatred

* Reason for misunderstanding is built into the theory - its a stage theory but its not stages
  * If you don't call it stages, you don't have a theory - just a box of legos (information)
* The difference between grief with hope and grief without hope
  * Appropriate grief vs. numbed or exaggerated grief experience
  * Will follow very different sequence in terms of emotions, actions, outcomes, consequences

* 1 Samuel 30 - David + men came back and found women + children captured
  * Devastating loss of family + possessions
  * Initial Reaction - Immediate and intense outpouring of grief
    * Wept til they had no more strength to weep
  * Fork in the road between constructive + destructive sorrow
    * Destructive
      * Men were "bitter in soul" (the malcontents, losers, and people in trouble were the ones following David around)
      * Scapegoating, anger, hostility
      * Want to stone David
      * Grieved without true hope
    * Constructive
      * David strengthened himself in the Lord
      * Sought God's will
      * Acted in a constructive solution-oriented way
      * Grieved in hope
* In both cases, there is a process, but with different components

* Depression stage of grief process is an emotional flattening

* Grief in hope
  * Face head on
  * Degree fits loss
  * Appropriate
  * Simple/clean
  * Goes somewhere
    * Increase and purification of hope
    * Appropriate action
    * Increase in compassion and love for others
* Grief with no hope
  * Denial
  * Overwhelming/crushed
  * Hypersensitized
  * Complicated/dirtied
    * Anger
    * Drunk
    * Bargaining
    * Cynicism
  * "Acceptance"... move on
