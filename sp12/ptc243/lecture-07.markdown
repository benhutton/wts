# The Berenstain Bears

* Good
  * Parents have a right and a responsibility to correct their children
  * Influence/manipulate behavior
  * Gimmies are not a stage, they're a given
  * Vivid portayal of smug superiority
  * Everybody knows this - highly relatable - describes phenomena very well
    * Problem is "the gimmies" - an everyday problem
  * Intergenerational conversation, asking for and offering help
  * Giving in, it just gets worse
  * Parents are somewhat responsible for children's behavior
  * Term "gimmies" = want + entitlement
  * Marked criticism of moralism as ineffectual
  * Practical action plan
  * Parents tend to divide; children tend to split parents
  * Embarrassment is motive for all of Papa Bear's behavior
  * It is hard for parents to know what to do
  * Not ascetic

* Critique/difference
  * Tension between advice/perspective and powerlessness
  * Irony - Papa Bear - had bad parenting, was a bad parent
  * Manipulation - teaches kids how to manipulate parents
  * "get" and "have" are passive verbs, "case" is a medical term - no sense of personal responsibility
  * End result is smug, not love/humility/gratitude
    * Why be ashamed when you can shame
  * Problem magnified - situational + parental variables
    * Person as moral agent is minimized to essentially nothing
    * Nothing going on inside you - all manipulation of behavior
    * Solution is parents changing what they do to manipulate a different kind of behavior
  * No moral framework at all (even though they throw out terms like greed)
    * Lusts of the flesh are peeking out (failure of repression in the model)
  * No discipline

Response (undesirable, but not bad)
Drive (given)

# Cognitive Behavior Therapy

* This is the dominant model in US - insurers cover it and its the most used by psychotherapists
* Very American - problem-solving, figure out the problem and fix it
* No moral depth, highly pragmatic, no questions of inner meaning and purpose

1st phase - behaviorism (WWI to 1960s, 50 years)
2nd phase - cognitive-behavior approach (1960s to mid 1990s, 30 years)
3rd phase - EFT, DBT, ACT, focusing on significance of emotions and suffering

* This history is capturing how pressure of failure and God-centered reality forces theories to change
  * Theories are getting better, but they're equally godless
* CBT appears in the Bible - Paul in Athens - Stoic philosophers tried to help people not get so upset by the things that happened in their daily lives
  * Practical Stoic Philosophy

* CBT Model - very logical
  * People often "feel bad"
  * Goal is "feeling good"
  * Feelings and mood are top layer - point of entry and goal
  * Changes in behaviors lead to a change in feeling and mood (people not only feel bad but also act in self-defeating ways)
  * Cognitions affect behaviors and mood. They are not revelatory of who you are, but can be self-defeating
    * Cognitive distortions are things people really do
    * Good thinking is realistic, rational, self-endorsing, positive, logical, objective
  * Belief system, silent assumptions
    * DAS looks at idols: approval, love, achievement, perfectionism, entitlement, omnipotence, autonomy (last idol standing)
  * Intrinsic worth/self-esteem
    * Self-esteem is most important question

* Self-defeating because he claims to be unbiased and not influenced by a psychiatrist's personal philosophy... yet what he's presenting is a personal philosophy
