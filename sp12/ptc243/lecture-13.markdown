# Criticisms

1. "You deny common grace and general revelation."
  * Essentially a theological and epistemological critique
  * No need for extra-biblical engagement
2. "You think you have nothing to learn from outside the Bible."
3. "You view the Bible as a textbook for counseling, so therefore there is a prooftext for every problem/solution/methodology."
  * Its as if the decisive characteristic for counseling is the citation or proclamation of a prooftext
  * Prooftext is necessary for diagnosis and prescription
  * How could you do Biblical counseling with nonchristians?
4. "You take an 'against Psychology' stance."
  * Unbelievable that you could be so irrational, narrow-minded, and negative
5. "You think that all problems reduce to sin."

* Its always worth asking if the shoe fits... is it true?
* Six key terms - interrelating, always operative, core theological perspectives
  * Special revelation
    * God has revealed himself to a fallen world redemptively, restoratively, bringing light into darkness
    * This is the only way we know about saving grace, can have an operative category of extrabiblical revelation, can know about effects of sin, how to interpret and understand general revelation, and is foundational for common grace
    * We learn that there is a meaningfulness within suffering
    * Foundational reality, out of which we are Christians
    * Living word of a living God who brings us forth by his word of power, truth, and love
    * Word incarnate, word written, word written onto our hearts work in tandem
    * Bavinck: 
  * Saving grace
    * Dinstinction between revelation and grace - revelation is what is revealed, and grace is what is done
    * God applies the work of Christ to his children
    * Illumines, calls, forgives, unites, joins, gives us hope
    * One of the ways God providentially works towards nonchristians (in and through God-suppressing psychology) to carry out his saving works
      * Bible is full of how God uses pagan kings to protect his children
      * God's purposes are contrary to the intentions of nonchristians
      * We all understand, by saving grace and special revelation, that the Gimmes are something wrong
  * Extrabiblical information
    * Knowledge of what is - people, suffering, etc.
    * We have divine warrant for studying the world. We need extrabiblical revelation. The need to gain extrabiblical knowledge to understand the Bible itself is not an onerous necessity. - Frame
    * Need it to understand ourselves, to converse with each other, etc.
    * First question in any counseling situation: "What is your name?"
      * This is extrabiblical information
    * Most of what people call "common grace" and "general revelation" would be better described as "extrabiblical information"
      * Implication is that you deny the need for extrabiblical information
    * All extra-biblical revelation needs special revelation for us to make sense of it
      * How are we using the can opener
      * Christian and nonchristian share every fact in common metaphysically, but we share no facts in common ethically, because we live in different worlds before God
  * Noetic effects of sin
    * The Berenstains don't see what the Gimmes really are because of the noetic effects of sin
    * Natural man uses his skills to describe the facts of creation as if they exist with no relation to God - Van Til
    * Failure in the world of christian psychology to reckon with this
      * Knowledge is viewed in cumulative terms
    * When the worldview grid is God-suppressent, you will fail to understand things how they are
    * Some in the biblical counseling movement only see the antithesis and miss the fact that we inhabit the same world and have many things to learn (common grace!)
  * General revelation
    * God reveals himself in all that is and all that happens
    * If general revelation reveals God, it reveals people too 
    * We don't integrate with general revelation - that's mis-understanding what general revelation is
    * Inirradicable working of the human conscience, even in most chaotic and darkened human being, reveals the image of God
    * Every human being is continually colliding with the real God (desire, belief, behavior, emotion)
    * Improvement of behavior psychologies (Pavlov -> Skinner -> CBT -> Third Wave) reveals need to hit on how world actually is
  * Common grace
    * Not about neutral facts just laying out there to be analyzed
    * Popular notion of common grace is that it deals with neutral facts - Van Til
    * Good things God does in a broken fallen world
      * World is full of good, beautiful, insightful, rich, wise, nourishing things
      * "That other working through which God through steady progress equips human life ever more fully against suffering and brings it fully to richer development" - Van Til quoting Kuyper
      * Concern for helping victims of earthquakes
      * Development of handicapped access
      * Defeating of racism
      * Advances in medicine
    * Restrains evil, checks the reckless destructiveness of sin (evildoers always lose)
    * Common grace is good but never good enough
      * Always has feet of clay - tends to get oversold as salvific
  * God's judgment on the world
    * God's reality contradicts the wrongness of the world
    * Ongoing sabotage of the darkness
  * Church is always failing and being reformed/renewed

* "Integrating theology and common grace insights" is NOT the way to put it
  * Theology is about common grace
  * Insight is extrabiblical information, and needs special revelation to not be God-suppressant anymore
* "Integrating Christian truths with the truths of general revelation"

* The greater part of our wisdom consists in understanding the relationships of complementary truths - Dr. Gaffin
