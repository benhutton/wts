# Does God Have A Motivation Theory?

Does the Bible teach a specific way to understand human motivation?

* There is more than one
  * Set of interlocking and complementary truths, all of which are needed
* God chooses to reveal to us the actual operative motivational dynamics of the human heart
  * God reveals the true psychodynamic
  * God tells us what he sees, how he weighs and evaluates instincts/drives/needs
  * God is committed to teach us to understand ourselves

1. Antithesis structure (Fall)
  * Fundamental either-or at the heart of motivation
  * Either life is ruled by these things (1-7) or ruled by fundamental loyalty to the Living God and his Kingdom and will and person
  * Fundamental antipathy shows itself in 
    * suppression (explicity) - other motivation theories are suppressing the fundamental either-or
    * substitution (implicit) - something in the place of God
    * To live for money, I need to suppress the knowledge that there is something else to live for and substitute money in place of God
  * Represents that there has been a devastating fall
  * Desires are disordered (inordinate)

2. Priority structure (Creation)
  * Meant to have primary loyalty to God, kingdom, will, person
  * And everything else is a good gift meant to flourish under God
  * Can't just have the antithesis - otherwise you despise human life
  * Need desires for good things rightly ordered
  * good goods, bad gods
  * Live for the giver, not the gifts

* The things that all people everywhere instinctively pursue are good in themselves but evil as ends in themselves
* We all seek blessings, not curses, and know the difference between the two

3. Consequence structure (Just Judgment)
  * If you live for them, you'll lose them (maybe sooner, always later)
  * If you don't live for them, you'll gain them (maybe sooner, always later)
  * The things that motivate all people are given sooner or later to everyone who gets priorities correctly oriented
  * If you live for things, you will lose all
  * If you live for God, you will gain all
  * Everything on the list (1-7) will be fulfilled perfectly in heaven
  * Hell is the hedonic nightmare, the absence of all good
  * Really makes sense of the work of Christ
    * Christ enters the absence of all of these things (pain, adultery, destitute, abandoned, oppressed by authorities, achievement apparently comes to nothing, mocked at the center of identity)
    * All the blessings are later - for the joy set before him
  * Judgment is happening all the time, not just at the end - the things people are living for die all the time
    * Judgment is concrete and specific
      * Someone who lives for health dies
      * Someone who lives for money... can't take it with you
      * Nothing lasts
  * In the resurrection, all that is good wins and all that is death loses

4. (more than) Redemption structure
  * Savior who is committed to transform us wrt antithesis and priority structure
  * Three substructures
    1. Mercy Structure (past tense) - solution does not lie within us, but Christ comes from without bringing mercy and power 
      * Mercy involves sacrifice, the passive obedience of Jesus dying in the place of sinners - Christ bearing the death that all of the empty things deserve
      * Active obedience of Jesus - his goodness credited toward us; we are saved by the righteousness of another
        * Christ was the rightly ordered man
    2. (present tense) - Jesus as shepherd, teacher, giver of HS, life giver, one who transforms us
      * FROM things TO rightly ordered priorities
    3. Completeness Structure (future tense) - Jesus as returning king; when we see him we will be like him, Jesus died to make us good (make us orderly human beings)

"The longings of the human heart cannot be changed." - Larry Crabb

Premise of the Bible is that the longings MUST be changed, or else you perish

* Prayer is about what you feel you really need
  * (1-7) are not what drives the awareness of need in the Bible
  * 1 Kings 3 - Solomon asked for wisdom instead of (1,3,5)
  * Prayers of scripture reflects true needs
    * Mercy, wisdom

* Thanksgiving
  * General Thanksgiving from 1611 BCP

## Implications

1. Secular motivation theories do not understand people
  * Antipathy to God destroys the ability to understand the things you are trying to understand
  * Trying to make sense of how football is played, but one team is invisible and you can only see one team. Try figuring out the rules/processes/dynamics
  * Once you see 2 teams, you can understand football
  * Shouldn't surprise us that secularity is self blinded - human heart is deceitful and desperately sick
2. Christian theorists who deny that the Bible reveals a motivation theory or who import an alien theory in do not understand what the Bible does teach
  * Everything we've been talking about doesn't sound like a personality theory - it sounds like theology
  * Bible teaches a God-centered motivation theory
