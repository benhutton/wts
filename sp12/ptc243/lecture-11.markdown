# Wisdom in Cure of Souls

* Suffering, obsessions, anxiety, dispair, conflict, addition - the problems of a broken world

* Historically, Church always tooks its cues off of Scripture
  * What ailed us - sin and misery - is something that the Gospel of Christ is the only answer to
  * Freud recognized this - pastoral work was the original

* In 1800s, Church's energies become preoccupied elsewhere
  * Faith is being undermined by liberalism: atonement, resurrection, incarnation, etc. trashed
  * Intellectual pastoral energy was put into the defense of the Christian faith against assault
  * Nothing gets published in America from about 1850 (Ichabod Spencer)
  * Net effect: cure of souls becomes empty religious forms
    * No articulate showing how preaching/prayer/scripture/etc. connect with how people are actually suffering
    * "You need to just pray and trust Jesus" - right answer, in a way, but no connection with real life
    * Becomes a caricature of itself
    * Primitive analysis, method - Abbott

* Response: self-consciously secular competitor in cure-of-souls
  * By 1955, church had no programs, no books on counseling, no experts
  * Spectrum between hard secularity (Freud, Skinner, Berenstain Bears, CBT) and soft/spiritual secularity (Jung (mystical), Adler (moral))

* Mainline Protestant churches
  * Refer to secular experts
  * Subordinating the work of the Church to secular mental health professions
  * Defer/adopt lightly Christianized models
  * Boissen - liberal pastor interpreted a breakdown in terms of sin, attempted to reclaim a more Christianized understanding
  * 1965 - "Rogers with a dash of Freud" - be nice, listen well, and help people understand deep dark forces inside (a little)
  * Get a spectrum, trying to rebiblicize and retheologize pastoral care (Don Browning, Don Carps, Ellen Charny)

* Church became extraneous to the cure of souls - truth was coming out of the secular world
  * Structurally extraneous, practically weak
  * Who can handle impact and treatment of extreme suffering, death/dying, human motives/"why", conscience, addictions, marriage, children, obsessions
  * Who can handle process and care?
    * Church eventually gets squeezed out to lifeboats off the side
      * Too external
        * Religious knowledge (doctrine)
        * Religious practices (prayer, Bible reading, preaching, Lord's Supper - disciplines of the Christian life)
        * Religious activism (evangelism, missions, mercy ministry, small groups, accountability structures, discipleship)
        * Religious ethics (positions on issues such as abortion, homosexuality
      * Too internal
        * Religious experience
        * Religious spirit-warfare (Satan is only animistic)
        * Religious corporate/sacredotal mysticism (Lord's supper magic, priest as mystical intermediary)
    * Bible itself operates on the ocean liner and critiques the lifeboats

* Church has bad habits in approaching scripture
  * Atomizing the Bible (breaking the Bible into lots of little bits; prooftexting)
    * Ignoring the Bible (because you can't atomize it successfully)
  * Abstracting and systematizing - need both Biblical and Systematic theology, but both are forms of abstracting, because Scripture is practical theology
    * Truth is staged and prioritized according to pastoral needs
  * Fragmenting the problem of evil - end up getting either sin theologies or suffering theologies - need to deal with "problems of evils"
  * Moving from text to person - Bible authors are just as often person to text; need to research people and understand them, to go back to the text
  * Expecting perfection - expecting instant, dramatic change. Bible talks starkly about sin and holiness, but also about the mingling of the two; amazing that "love is patient" is first

* Evangelical Psychotherapists/Integration
  * Spectrum
    * Myers - Levels of Explanation - Correlation between different levels - first generation of integration, less epistemologically self aware - Christian truth + Psych truth = lots of truth
      * 1965 - Fuller
      * 1970 - Talbot, TEDS
    * Everyone else - Christin faith should lead the discussion
      * Jones (1980 - Wheaton)
      * Crabb
      * Roberts
      * Coe

* Biblical counseling
  * A center, desire to revitalize religious forms... reorient the lifeboats and the oceanliner

* Factors in our favor
  * Philosophy of science
  * Postmodernism (rejecting grand unified theory)
  * Church history
  * Globalization (showing counseling models fail)/cross cultural
  * Current developments
