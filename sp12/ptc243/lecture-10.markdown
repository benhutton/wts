# Part 3: Ministry In A Psychologized Culture / Apologetic Engagement

## Two metaphors/pictures

* Upstream/Downstream
  * Downstream are the cities: things are "vulgarized"
    * Sick people and well people are essentially different
    * DSM labels = "real" things
    * Do understand why people are these ways (biological or social)
    * Medications/therapies cure 
    * Go to people = secular mental health personnel; church is fundamentally irrelevant
  * Upstream is the mountains: things are purer
    * Humility; cautious assertions; qualifying
    * Recognition of limits
    * Thoughtful internal criticism
    * Humor
    * Ever-ramifying fractal complexity
      * Can't explain what a person is

* "Nurture works on what nature endows"
  * Nature/nuture donut in space
  * Intro psych textbook
    * Little place for the person inside
      * People have expectancies, schemata, hopes, desires
      * Personality theories that all totally disagree with each other
  * Therapists 
    * CBT - cognitive distortions
    * Freud
  * Barber posits an infinitely intricate dance between nature and nurture, but doesn't talk about what a person is

* Isolated soul on the mountaintop = church's view
  * Soul in the middle, locked in cosmic conflict between forces of darkness and God

* Should be person in the middle of everything
  * Person
  * Embodied - In a body with gifts (multiple intelligences, etc.) and limitations (AIDS/Alzheimers)
  * Embedded - socially embedded - how does the individual relate to the group?
  * Satan - evil, animate being behind the death that besets our bodies, lies that beset cultures, and deceptive idolatrous lusts that destroy human beings
  * Living God - sovereign over all things

* We don't need to understand it all, for ministry. We can help people with limited comprehension, even of ourselves.

## Interacting with non-Christians

* Rhetoric - how do you persuade someone? How does an argument become so effective that you move people to change?
  * So very important for Christians
  * 3 components
    * Speaker - ethos
      * Can't contradict the message
      * Humility
      * Personal factors/experience
    * Hearer - pathos
      * Difference in audience/setting
    * Message - logos
      * Argument, making a case
      * For something and against something
  * 3 purposes that drive
    * Inform
    * Convince
    * Motivate
  * Correlates to 3 parts of faith
    * Knowledge
    * Assent
    * Trust and act and do something based on what you've heard about
  * Five stage process, how does the speaker engage the hearer
    * Know the hearer - knowing their terrain, knowing about them
    * Enter their world - enter their frame of reference, go on their ground, quote their authorities, talk about our weaknesses/failures and their strengths
    * Retell their story - from your point of view, expose the fatal flaw/inner contradiction/unsolved question, make them comfortable/familiar and uncomfortable/dissonance 
    * Tell your story afresh - in a way that shows dissonance; different every time; appropriate to everything that's come before
    * Call to reorientation - call to have a conversation; be profoundly persuaded that it is God alone who saves
