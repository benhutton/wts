# Sigmund Freud

* Effective evangelist and apologist
  * Apologetics are going all ways at all times
  * Anticipates the audience's questions, leads with questions, starts with questions
  * Meets the audience on their ground, at the level of their worldview, biases, education
  * He agrees with the interlocutor up to a point, anticipates his defense
  * He would go after inner contradictions and fatal flaws - data that can't be accounted for
  * Has picture of how discipleship happens once evangelism has been successful
    * Invites people to get analyzed themselves
  * Intellectually humble
  * Witty and ironic
  * The esoteric is intriguing, a nice defensive move - makes you wait for him to explain and resolve
  * Overtly a testimonial - bearing witness
    * Requiring others to trust him as a witness
  * Credits audience with being impartial and unbiased and able to come to a good conclusion
  * Quotes the cultural authorities - literature, philosophers, playwrights
* "Master of Suspicion" - Freud, Marx, Nietzsche
  * Revealed dark secrets about the human soul
  * Penetrated illusions
* W. H. Auden wrote poem when Freud died
  * Not a person, but a whole climate of opinion
* Nobody was writing about a talking approach to human problems

* Information/observations
  * Starts off by describing people with problems
    * Doesn't use category terms but just describes them
  * Most of the time things there is no need for a doctor - no physiological component
    * Need to pay attention to it, but it isn't common
    * If there are any doubts, have a doctor take a look
  * Patients are not really patients, doctors are not really doctors, laymen are not really laymen
    * Inconsistent in that he won't say "the illnesses are not really illnesses"
    * But says that this is something qualitatively different from what medicine deals with
  * Later gets to a model of "pastoral work" - "salvation army" - "cure of souls"
    * Recognizes that what he's fundamentally doing is pastoral
    * Ideal metaphor comes out of pastoring, not out of doctoring
  * Reason for book was opposition to licensure for counseling
    * Defends the right of Christian Science practicioners to do what they do
    * Consists only in talking - no instruments - only encouragement, explanations, and healthy human influence
    * Defending the right of ministry to do ministry
  * Normality of the counseling conversation
    * What Freud calls transference, we should call reality - showing you their heart
  * Counseling is less dangerous than surgery, far less likely to hurt people

* Freud Psychoanalysis in Street Talk
  * Tries to make things normal
    * Closer you get to normal, closer you get to how life is
    * Terms are invested in the model
    * If you give things labels, you make it hard to see how the Bible applies
    * Demythologizing/demystifying
  * The classic image of psychotherapy is that it is very different from what Christians do - (not imposing values)
    * Shows that this is human influence too - involves all the things Christians would do
    * Steadily infiltrates values; not neutral or objective
  * Textbooks end up abstracting Freud. This tries to humanize Freud
  * Accurately states Freud's theory
    * Puritanical wrt sex, not a libertine

# Prozac By Any Other Name

* Information
  * Concerned that people are not dealing with underlying issues
  * There are a class of problems that are "about something", and there are just problems (broken leg, etc.)
    * Things that just are = suffer from, have
  * "Gut level" epistemology
  * Something comes out, makes itself known
  * Image before others - don't want people to know you're taking something for depression
  * Image before myself - don't want to admit this
  * Not hostile to fact that there can be a biological component - there is a chemical piece in PMDD
  * Prozac isn't guaranteed to work
  * Economic engine
  * Economic metaphor
  * Emotions are complex and there are often multiple things going on at once
  * Obvious/clear in the video = clearly not just hormones, but there's a real upsetness
* Interpretation
  * Fatal flaw or internal contradiction
    * Whole thing rises or falls on idea of mental illnesses - they're not illnesses but they're illnesses
    * Replace "mental illness" with "fallenness" or "disfunctional worship disorder"
* Is he a Freudian?
  * Yes
    * Unconscious motives
    * Repression
    * "mental illness" = neurosis, psychogenic
    * hiding from hard realities
    * Therapy/cure is to acknowledge and understand what's driving you and accept your dark side
  * No, he's a freudian (lower case f)
    * "mental illness" both/and about somatic and psychogenic
      * Freud: either/or about somatic and psychogenic
    * contents of psyche are more flexible (social, etc)
      * Freud: contents of psyche are sexual

* CS Lewis: I believe in Christianity as I believe in the sun - by it I see everything else
* Bonhoeffer: Psychologist knows infinitely less about the human heart than the simplest question. Cannot grasp what sin is. In the presence of a psychiatrist, I can only be a sick man.

* Want simple, not simplistic, interpretations of complex information
  * "You either serve God or mammon"
