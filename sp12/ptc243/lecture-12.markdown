# Lecture 12

* Gap between
  * Destination/Goal: What does it mean to counsel biblically?
  * Achievement/Current Wisdom: "Biblical Counseling"
* Gives you...
  * Present humility and a firm, non-negotiable destination
* Non-negotiables
  * What is Jesus about? Incarnate, walking the earth, gracious, compassionate, forgiving, yet holding accountable intransigence
  * Entrance and exit exams are the same
    * What are you living for? Who do you love? Where do you turn? What do you think about me? Core loyalties... What is the controlling center of your life purpose?
    * How do you live? Where are you turning right now? How are you turning out? How's your life turning out? How are you treating people? How are you loving people? Do you bear others' burdens?
  * Jesus is continually coming to people failing these questions and offering himself as the savior of the world
* How are we doing at that?

* Self criticism is hard enough... being criticized by other people is way harder
  * There is a kind of criticism that is a wonderful acquired taste
    * Fairminded, constructive, respectful, you know you're loved, talks about strengths and weaknesses
    * Never fun, but needed
  * Summary criticism - comprehensively pushed aside
    * No recognition of any redeeming qualities
    * Much harder to hear
    * Hard to figure out what to take to heart
  * Revileant - "You're not only wrong, you're an idiot, God's wasting oxygen on you, and your mother's ugly too"
    * Hardest of all
    * Jesus is reviled and mocked and held forth as the extreme and the example of how to handle this
    * Must be "patient when wronged"
    * 2 Tim 2:22
      * "Flee youthful passions" - criticism ignites typical passions like self-righteousness, defensiveness, counterattack
      * "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, calling on the Lord from a pure heart" - worth living and dying for these things; live consistent with our message
      * "Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies" - don't fight about terms (get to meaning)
      * "They breed quarrels. The Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome" - Christianity and quarrelsomeness is an unstable hybrid; we are peacemakers (not peace lovers or war lovers), so you fight for the goal of peace
        * Hostility and quarreling is a primal defection from reality
      * "But kind to everyone" - basic fundamental goodness that bears in mind the wellbeing of other people; mark of the work of the loving savior in our lives - able to take people to heart with an essential stance of kindness
        * Fundamental intention of kindness, not hatred, even when actions and words are firm
        * "He died to make us good"
        * Paul is not moralizing us here, but calling us to the image of God
      * "Able to teach" - the ability to connect Biblical truth to actual life, the real questions they have, the things they're talking about, to make the jargon make sense
      * "Patiently enduring evil" - in it for good, even when its hard and easy to get discouraged
      * "Correcting his opponents with gentleness" - not just degenerating into niceness, but careful, thoughtful arguments based on understanding people and the ways of God
      * "That God may perhaps grant them repentance" - You are only a servant, a dependent. Every knee will bow to Jesus, not you. Allows you to hang in for as long as it takes. We're not the ones that win the battle, ultimately.
