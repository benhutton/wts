# Depth of Moral Vision

* How profoundly is this psychological theory grappling with the human condition?
* Opaque glass floor
  * Above it are things that are wholely observable
    * Shallowest approach is biopsychiatry - bodies to manage
      * Alleviate and reduce the symptoms that are unpleasant to a person
    * Then behaviorism (the gimmies never come under examination) - behavior to manage
      * If your kids can't go out in public without throwing fits, lets figure out a system of reinforcement to change things
    * Then cognitive behavioral  - thoughts to manage -> emotions
      * If you can manage the bad thoughts, then you won't have the bad feelings
  * Below it are things going on on the inside
    * Dysfunctional attitudes - something invisible going on inside you - primitive psyche-dynamic
    * Psychological needs - primitive psyche-dynamic
      * Self esteem
      * Love/acceptance/security/relationship
      * Significance/achievement
    * Adler's inferiority complex vs. love
      * Drive towards superiority, success, achievement
    * Freud's eros and thanatos
      * Issues going on get darker and darker <--> self-restraint
      * Pleasure principle and death principle
      * Goal of human beings is love and work
    * Existential Therapy
      * Questions of good and evil
      * Questions of meaning and futility
      * Arose in central Europe in the wake of WWII and WWI
    * Thoughtful literature
      * Every good novelist deals with moral evil
  * Hard brass floor - no man or woman can see beneath this floor; only Christian faith has the moral depth to actually deal with everything that people are
    * Christian faith makes the best sense out of everything we know
    * Jeremiah 17:9, Ecc 9:3 - human heart is incomprehensible
    * God has revealed a word that lays bare the thoughts and intentions of the heart (Heb 4:12-14)

* Theoretical, epistemological despair, causing move towards atheoretical fixes

* Knowledge is increasing, theories are multiplying and unity is decreasing
  * There is no tentative approximation of the truth that is getting closer and closer to Christian reality

# Psychotherapies

* Therapist-Patient relationship
  * Nicholi is some of the best upstream material, even while there is still a brass floor
  * Freud predicted a lot of this
    * "Personal influence is our most powerful dynamic weapon"
    * "Doctor makes use of one of the components of love... love is the great educator"
  * What did we like and appreciate
    * Attitudes - humility, care, respect - humanizing
    * Helper-persons bring who they are (life experience, attitudes, etc.)
    * Humility
      * Something to learn from the needy one
      * No person reduces
      * People are considerably complex
    * Helper has own "stuff" - pathologies, fears, desires, chaos, countertransference
    * Helper self-aware
    * Identification - considerably more like himself than different
    * Communicate without jargon
    * Listening - practical implications and barriers
    * Patients' "stuff" - revelatory and real
    * He is really FOR people
    * Uses the term "agape"
    * Hammers sexual immorality as destructive
    * Very sensitive to suffering
  * What did he get wrong/blinker out
    * Misused "agape" - its NT's word for Exodus 36:6-7
    * Never talked about sinfulness or moral culpability
    * Therapist/patient language is unrelenting and controlling
    * No outside help, no God
    * Transference = people express their sins/fears/struggles/confusion

* Prochaska and Norcross
  * "Psychotherapy... assists people... in directions that the participants deem desirable" - very against a Christian approach
  * Positive expectations = putting your faith and hope and trust in something
    * They present this as neutral
    * We look at that and think "you put your faith in someone and they may very well lead you to hell"
  * Client vs patient
    * Client is fee for service
    * Patient is a sufferer in need of help
    * Friend, brother or sister, person, hurting person
    * "Individual" is used too...
    * None of our words are individualistic - they're relational
  * Therapist, clinician, healer, psychotherapist, practitioner, mental health professional
    * Friend, brother, sister, shepherd, pastor, partner, minister (servant)
  * Hawthorne Effect - people really benefit by having people pay attention and care
    * This is why its meaningful when people ask "how are you doing?"
  * Commonalities
    * "Emotionally charged and confiding relationship" - relationship where you can be honest and talk about real stuff
    * "Healing setting" - a situation that has a constructive, nourishing, life transforming purpose
    * "Rationale or conceptual scheme" - it actually matters! we have something we can offer to make sense of things that offers hope, mercy, power, guidance, challenge, repentance, obedience
    * "Therapeutic ritual" - Planning to meet and talk, kindness and interest and interaction are in a way rituals (loving, knowing, asking, speaking)
    * "Warm, inspiring, socially sanctioned therapist" - a friend
    * "Opportunity for catharsis" - Francis Bacon, "An Essay on Friendship" - with no friends, you become cannibals of yourself; the opening and unburdening of a man's heart to his friend redoubles joys and cuts griefs in half
    * "Acquisition and practice of new behaviors" - Talk to your wife differently, apologize to your roommates, tell your parents you love them (or confront them)
    * "Exploration of the inner world of a patient" - getting insights and new ways of understanding
    * "Suggestion" - push back, not imposing values
    * "Interpersonal learning" - faith rubs off on each other, ability to be candid about sins and sorrows
  * His examples and case studies were kind of lame
    * What constitutes change? People are different in some way, but is it lasting?


  how are these things not needs?

  Undershepherd is a sheep who is not totally preoccupied with his own patch of grass and the wolves howling (fear + desire)
