# Moral Depth

* Don't mean that everything above the glass floor is bad... that is, don't mean that moral depth is necessarily good
* Could say that things above the glass floor might be better, because they're working with things that are more straightforward in life
  * More common grace
  * biopsychiatry - stabilize extremes
  * behaviorism - skill learning has implicit rewards (or explicity) - learning to walk or toilet train
  * cbt - continual dialog at the level of the most overt contents of a person's life; can Christianize fairly easily (though no longer cbt)
  * healthy lifestyle
  * healthy social system - economic opportunities, improvement in conditions, political justice, etc.
* Any of these can try to drift below the line and be salvific 
  * Behaviorism can try to deal with sin and righteousness instead of just skill learning
* Religion is the universal obsessional neurosis of the human race - Freud
  * Dynamic operating that makes the brass floor brass is a universal obsessional neurosis - the suppression of the knowledge of the true God
  * Shows up in false religion or bad religion (because it is suppressing the real God)
  * Irreligion (atheism) is still guilty

# Larry Crabb

* Adams and Crabb argued against the other Christian Psychologists
  * Agreed that sin was the big problem
  * Agreed that Bible should have more weight than psychology
  * Agreed that there was an active counselor role
  * But not allies; they were cobelligerents
* Powlison owes debt to Crabb in his thinking
  * Catalytic and provocative influence
  * Adams downplayed situational dynamic; core problems were problems of obedience
  * Could see that Crabb was talking about questions that were really important, that Jay Adams hadn't answered
  * Answers were grating and off key though
* Dynamics model
  * World is controlled by Sovereign God, who has spoken into the world
  * Life is loaded with consequences - everything matters
  * Very careful to talk about the specifics about sin and righteousness
    * Don't just tell a husband to love his life, help him walk through how to love this life
    * Genuine wisdom built upon a close analytic of the follies that people tend to live by
  * Give what you command and command whatever you will - Augustine
    * HS must give the willing and the working
  * Crabb was catalyst to look at heart issues or situational issues

* When the Bible uses the thirst metaphor, what aspect of human experience is being captured?
  * Need/desire for God as life giver
  * Psalm 42 - deer panting for water, man panting for God
  * Lusts of the flesh, desires of the heart
  * Thirsting for righteousness
  * Literal primal human need
  * Metaphor - loss or absence of any good thing
  * Outcry of need
  * Curse/wilderness
  * Subjective experience
  * Natural affections (creational) vs. inordinate affections
    * Wired by creation to know they're good
  * Longing for final blessings
* Forsake God as life giver
* Dig cisterns to falsely trust in idols
* Thirst is a foretaste of death - tasting the curse
  * Thirst is the condemnation - having forsaken God, they will die
* Not everyone will thirst for relationships... some will long for money, power, ease, etc.
* Every theory is biographical... does your theory fit God's metanarrative?

* The job of ministry is to unbalance truth for the sake of application (can't say everything, so stage them, say one thing at a time, etc.)
* The job of a theologian is to rebalance truth for the sake of comprehensiveness

* Jay Adams - problem of unruliness... sees clearly sins of license and undiscipline... issue is self-indulgence and self-will
  * Tends to be admonitory; emphasis on present grace (work of HS)
  * Ephesians
  * Problem is sin, goal is faith and love
* Jack Miller - problem of discouraged, earnest Christians who try hard to live the Christian life and fail
  * Tends to be encouraging; emphasis on past grace (justification and adoption)
  * Galatians, 2 Cor 5:14-15
  * Problem is sin, goal is faith and love
* John Piper - plodding, joyless, dull Christians just going through the motions
  * Tends to be proclaming glories of Christ; emphasis on future grace
  * 1 Peter
  * Problem is sin, goal is faith and love
* Joni Erickson Tada - problem of suffering
  * Testimony/story; emphasis on past, present, future grace for sufferers

* Piper tends to hit on the major key psalms

# My Empty, Secret Self Finds Fullness and Honesty in Jesus

* Positives
  * Struggled against impulses
  * Conscience accurate
  * Brought sin into the light, asked for help
  * "Secret comfort", "secret garden", "precious friend" = problem
    * Bettler: Christian life is the open life; nothing to hide
  * Mature theological vision
  * Involves husband and female friends; humility, reality to body of Christ
  * Gives glory to God
  * Locates struggle, aware of past factors and present temptations
  * Interpersonal version of mercy for strugglers
  * Not hostile, blameshifting - story is realistic, not grotesque
  * Recognizes that change is a process
  * Appropriate confession, not sensational
  * She seeks and finds the Lord who is her Savior
    * Psalm 50:15 - call on me in day of trouble, I will rescue you and you will honor me
  * God is the giver of what is needed
  * Active member of her church, part of teaching and ministry and helping people, using her gifts in the body of Christ
  * On the scale of action, her patterns are mild - she didn't act on her fantasy life

* Negatives
  * Her original views:
    * Thinks like a Pelagian: "If I didn't choose it, there must be some other cause"
      * Can't see "just is/there"
      * Wants an explanation for evil - but it makes no sense why people would sin
      * She can't realize that this is there/a problem because the counselor blames external environmental/historical factors
  * Counselor taught her:
    * Reasons for lesbian attraction is external (she knows its sin but explains all the reasons as external)
      * Personal history factors rooted in the family
      * "nurture" causality
    * Void/empty/longing/need view of the human heart (but doesn't really get to the heart)
      * But her heart isn't empty and passive - its actively full of fear of man; desiring warmth, intimacy, and safety and love from people
        * This never got dealt with
      * Humans are always active verbs
    * God as void-filler and need-meeter
      * God is means to an end, not the end
      * God forgives, relational

History = vile father, impotent mother => Lesbian fantasy [nurture and intimacy]
                                       => Edgy heterosexual [excitement and power]
                                       => Antisocial fearful isolation (asexual) [refuge/safety]
                                       => Escapist/numb with pleasure [avoidance/escape]
                                       => Hope of redemption that drives you to marry the same kind of man as her father [playing redeemer]
                                       => Live differently [honor of God]
History can make many things plausable... that's why it works so well. So, because it seems to explain everything, it really explains nothing.
  * Active view of the heart explains a lot better

* Sin = disposition, drift, willful choice, impulse, obsession, seeming happenstance, opportunistic, devil's appetite for souls, worlds shaping influence, God's hardening of hearts
