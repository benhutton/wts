* Everyone asks the questions:
  * How do we understand a person?
  * How do we help people?
* Church's engagement with psychologies is a divisive issue
  * Fear, anger, suspicion
  * Entering a war zone
  * Dispute, perplexity, complexity
  * Need clarity, definition of terms, sympathetic understanding
* Pursue irenics - fight by making peace
  * Pursue truth that creates peace and joy
* We must each choose - cannot remain neutral
  * We are always communicating a worldview

* Psychology is to modern America as Islam is to Saudi Arabia
  * Grief counsellors on TV after 9/11

* Christian truth can hold multiple seemingly contradictory things in its hands at once
  * Chesterton: we can liberate two seemingly contradictory views instead of choosing between them or compromising them
  * We are kings and queens of creation and wretched rebels
  * Church has trouble with psychology because it can't do this well

* Experiences summary
  * Good
    * Genuine desire to help
    * Respectful, non-attacking
    * Horizontal morals
    * Protection?
    * Common grace of holding accountable
    * Alternative to experience of Christianity/church (ignorance, judgmentalism, anti-intellectualism, hyper-theological intellectualism, no process for counseling or change, emotions invalidated)
    * Complexities about human experience
    * Roll up sleeves
    * Process
  * Bad
    * No vertical dimension, always implicitly some god principle in mind (self esteem)
    * God = delusion or legit only culturally
    * "Soft" science (high octane assertion about it)
    * Diagnostic determinism or identity
    * Dehumanizing?

* Identity is relational and conscience is derivative

* If no God, then no sin, as sin is a relational category, then no judgment, then no need for a savior or sanctification
  * Disallowed a priori, NOT because of the facts

* Psychologist disagreed about everything except that the answer to human troubles lies within themselves

* Common grace is a pointer to the one who is the author of special grace

* We're going to look at what psychologists get most right and then put it in the context of conscious, committed, overt Christian faith
