* Thorns = conflict, coveting, fighting, quarrelling, killing

* Inner person worship disorders
* Most people focus on their circumstances
  * Move them to a place where they are self aware, that its not their circumstances and really something going on inside
* "You do not ask God" - people typically forget God when things get hard, turn into functional atheists
* When you do ask God, treat him like a servant in the sky to deliver the goods so that circumstances get better
* You worship your way into sinful patterns, so you have to worship your way out of sinful patterns
* You worship your way into sinful actions, therefore you must worship your way into new godly responses

  * To be adulterous, you must first be married - James 4:4 assumes salvation
  * Spirit is jealous as we stray

Other people just say yes
Other people avoid and just leave the room
