## Session 1 - Placing Personal Change Within A Bigger Context

* Why does the Church need to think about personal and interpersonal problems?

Six Unavoidable Facts

1. Someone had a problem in your church this week.
2. We have everything we need in the Gospel to help that person (2 Peter 1:3).
3. That person will seek help first from friends, family members, or pastors before seeking professionals.
  * How much of the advice exacerbated the problem, and how much helped?
  * Need to equip friends + family members to think wisely about people and their problems
4. That person either got no help, bad help, or biblical gospel-centered help.
5. If they don't get meaningful help, they will go elsewhere.
  * Google, bookstore
6. Whatever help they received, they will use to help others!

* The task is pastoral apologetics
  * Usually thought of in evangelistic contexts
  * We persuade people that the grace of the Gospel is relevant for them
  * To the degree that we don't do this, they will find other forms of help

* Gospel Gap
  * People have understanding of past forgiveness and future hope
  * Don't know how who Jesus is and what he's done for them changes their relationship with their spouse, or helps them how they deal with sin
  * Don't know how the Gospel applies right now

* Common Gospel Replacements
  1. Formalism - going through the ritual
  2. Legalism - list of dos and don'ts
  3. Mysticism - emotional experiences
  4. Activism - fixing problems in society
  5. Biblicism - time in scripture can replace relationship with Christ
  6. Psychologism - what it means to be a Christian is that I'm having my needs met, Jesus is cosmic therapist
  7. Socialism - needing human acceptance
* What tends to be missing?
  1. The reality of remaining sin
  2. The centrality of the heart
  3. The present benefits of the work of Christ
  4. The need and presence of the Holy Spirit
  5. A lifestyle of ongoing repentance and faith
  6. A call to growth
  7. A call to community

* Ministry Gap (Instruments in the Redeemers Hands)
    * Casual Relationship
    * Formal Ministry
    * Everyday Life
  * "Who else in your church knows this besides me?"

* A Ministering Community - Colossians 3:12-17
  * Addressing the Gospel Gap: "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly..."
  * Addressing the Ministry Gap: "...as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom."

* Creating a culture of Christ-centered Change in the Local Church
    * Pastor
    * Elders
    * Deacons
    * Small Group Leaders
    * Parents
    * Children & Teens
    * Sunday School Teachers
    * Edifying Friendships
  * Same model throughout
  * Not overwhelmed
  * Not over their heads

* Do not be abducted by false "gospels" - Colossians 2:1-10
  * vv1-5 - Only true epistemology is in Christ
  * vv9-10 - We need power to do that
  * vv6-8 - 

## Session 2 - The Big Picture - Jeremiah 17:5-10

* In the context of a desert
  * Heat = circumstances... suffering or blessing; body; culture
  * Ungodly responses to heat
  * Godly responses to heat

* Learning about heat makes you more compassionate
* Idol hunts (here's your idol, go repent) are bad
* A Christians we're both fruitful and thorny
  * Can identify marks of the Spirit (not just idols)
* Extremes of unreflective activism and morbid introspection
* Introspection should lead you to the cross and to other people

* A Christian view of change
  * Not less than behavioral, but more
  * Not less than cognitive, but more
  * Covenantal... relationship
