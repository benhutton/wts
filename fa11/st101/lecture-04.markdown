# Prolegomena & Theology

## What is Revelation?

* Implications of dependence
* God's self-disclosure/speech
* Necessity of revelation
  * We don't force God to reveal himself - revelation is fully voluntary
  * Accomodation is necessary
* Revelation is as principium theologiae - cause, source, basis of theology
  * source - there is no theology apart from revelation
  * norm - theology is not checked by something outside of revelation. Has its own apparent authority.  Cognitive reflection of man does not sit in judgment over theology
  * beginning - ultimate starting point. Theology does not begin with us, but with God.
  * fons theologiae
* What does scripture say?
  * NT terms for Revelation
    * epiphaneo - to appear
    * emphanizo - to manifest
    * gnorizo - to make known
    * deloo - to disclose
    * deiknumi - to show/reveal
    * laleo - to speak (God is the speaker)
    * apokalupto - to uncover, reveal, show
    * phanereo
  * Central term in NT = musterion
    * Latin = sacramentum
    * False cognates
    * Nothing spooky or spiritually superior (gnostic sense)
    * In view = previously undisclosed secret.  Something not known prior, but is now known.
    * musterion is something given
    * It would not be known if God had not revealed it
    * Romans 11:25
    * We cannot put human wisdom and divine thought on par with one another
    * We are recipients, not creators of this knowledge
    * Highlights sovereignty of God as the giver
    * Romans 16:25-27 - revealed in OT, but answer of Jesus wasn't revealed yet
      * Organic connectedness of scripture
      * Question: is gospel and preaching according to revelation, or are they revelation
    * Historical contours of revelation - God of Paul is also the God of Abraham
    * Goal of revelation is "to bring about the obedience of faith"
    * Theology presupposes revelation and God
    * The climax of musterion is revelation in Jesus Christ
