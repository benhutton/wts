# General Revelation, Part 2

## General Revelation in Man

* The imago Dei
  * Waltke - "Fundamental to Genesis and the entirety of Scripture is the creation of humanity in the image of God."
  * The "internal principle" - Man is fit to know, to love, because he is created in the image of God
  * We have eyes and ears and hands because God knows, works, hears
  * Our very existence is designed for us to be receptors of and reflectors of God's revelation
  * All of our knowing and thinking is necessarily an imaging activity
* The Imago Dei and Revelation
  * Acts 17:22ff
    * vs24 - The God you call "unknown" is really the God you know, who made you
    * vs26 - "made from one man every nation" - unequivocal about a historic Adam
    * vs28 - showing that the poetic history recognizes the presence of the God who made heaven and earth. Implicit in this creating is an obligation to respond
* The Imago Dei and Covenantal Accountability
  * Romans 2:14-16 - those that don't have the law are still culpable because they are made in God's image and thus still have the law
    * "Writing" in the New Covenant is an enabling writing
    * Constraining function of the law upon the Gentiles
    * Sociology works to discern common moral threads around the world. Argue that this is from evolution
    * Paul argues that this is embedded in us because we are made in God's image

## Sufficiency of General Revelation

* Van Til: "At every stage in history God's revelation in nature is sufficient for the purpose it was meant to serve, that of being the playground for the process of differentiation between those who would and those who would not serve God."
  * Revelation is sufficient because it is given by God
  * Woven directly with the intention and purpose of God
* Sufficency for accountability: morally, religiously

## Insufficiency of General Revelation

* Not redemptive: no grace, no forgiveness disclosed
* Not complete: need for the concomitant

## Conclusions
  
* Revelation is 
  * Mediated
  * Divine
  * Benevolent
  * Objective - real content, real substance
  * Comprehensive, permeating - nothing does not communicate God. inescapable
    * Creation as the "theater" of God's glory (Calvin)
    * Isaiah 28:23-29 - farmer knows how to farm because God taught him to do it
  * Doxological - from God, to direct us to God
* General Revelation
  * Affirms psychological and metaphysical common ground
    * Made in God's image, examining the same data
  * Renders all of mankind accountable

* Shouldn't we not reason from man back to God
* What are we culpable for... rejecting Jesus, or rejecting God
