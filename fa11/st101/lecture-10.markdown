# Lecture 10 - Revelation

* Initial Considerations
  * Concept of revelation critiqued
    * Most in the West operate with a deeply entrenched denial of the plausibility of revelation
    * Man views himself as having the right to analyze and dimensionalize life
    * Post-Enlightenment trust in man
    * Voltaire: accuses Christians who believe God has spoken of blaspheming God
  * Responses to the criticism: lesewort or lebewort?
    * Scripture as living word, categorically different than any other documentation
    * Rationalists are operating with faith assumptions
  * What does the Bible say? What is general and special revelation? How do they interface?
  * What is the relationship between revelation and scripture?

* Creation as revelation
  * All creation is made by God and reveals God
    * Psalm 19:1 - The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
    * Romans 1:19-20 - For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.
      * Plain: clear, sufficient
      * Perceived: not only understandable, but understood
      * Embedded: in the things God has made. Cannot see the world correctly if we cannot see him.
      * Scope: since the creation of the world... nobody is outside this scope
      * Personal: theological, doxological
  * Revelation & religion
    * Principium of religion
      * Bavinck: religion assumes God reveals himself and makes himself known
    * Telos of revelation (ultimate purpose/goal)
      * Necessary coherence between beginning, end, middle
      * All of our thinking must drive us back to the Son of God
      * Final end of our thinking is the worshiping of Jesus
        * Why we have minds, lives
      * Revelation exists to drive us back to the God who made us, sustains us
      * Hebrews 1:3 - "phero" all things, deliver from one point to another, from the beginning to the end
      * God of redemption is the God of the history of redemption
  * Organic character of revelation
    * Does not happen in a vacuum. Doesn't use a medium foreign to the larger scope of revelation
    * Inscripturated revelation occurs within the broad scope of God's revelation
    * Direct connection between divine purpose and what is accomplished. God accomplishes through general revelation what he intends to accomplish
  * Knowledge of God, embedded component to revelational context

* General Revelation
  * Historic terminology
    * Not biblical terms
    * Used to distinguish the way God has revealed himself for accountability/judgment vs. for redemption
  * Scripture: revelation as natural or supernatural?
    * In one sense, ALL is supernatural
    * NOT that everything is miracle
    * But that everything is meant to point us to God
  * General revelation vs. Natural theology
    * Natural theology claims varying degrees of confidence on what man is able to derive from that objective data
    * Thomas Aquinas
      * Believed that there was not the degree of the effect of sin on the mind that the reformers came to believe
      * We can therefore come to pure conclusions about God and understanding him
    * Berkouwer: the "rupture between God's revelation and the human heart"
  * All revelation - general and special - as Divine
* Biblical revelation about general revelation
  * Psalm 19
  * The perpetual wordless preacher
    * Continual, unrelenting
    * Focus is on what creation does, not how well man understands it
    * Exhaustive scope
      * Psalm 97:6
      * Isaiah 40:25-26
    * Content
      * kabod (glory, weight)
      * tsedek (righteousness)
      * Judge
    * Other texts 
      * Job 12:7-9 - creation understands and teaches
      * Psalm 29:3-5 - the voice of God is in the storm
      * Psalm 65:5-13 - God sustains the world
      * Psalm 104:10-30 - God intervenes in the cycles of life
* Creation as revelation: Kindness of God
  * Acts 4:8-18 
    * God did not leave himself amartruron - without witness
    * Personal extension of benevolence rendering accountability
  * Matthew 5:45b - "he makes the sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust"
* Creation as revelation: Rebuke from God
  * Jeremiah 5:21-22 
    * God established the boundary of the seas. If we don't see this, we are foolish and senseless. 
    * The one who does not see the sea and see God does not see the sea.
* Suppressing General Revelation
  * Romans 1:18-32
    * Moral suppression of clear revelation leads them to draw inappropriate conclusions
    * Perspicuity - intelligible to every human
      * What is revealed is *the* God, and by suppression man has made its own gods
    * Continuity - gone on since creation of the world, full-sensory experience
    * Personal & substantival - "eternal power + divine nature" is shorthand for the Godness of God
    * Accountability
    * Mode of rejection is not ignorance but willful suppression
      * Because repression is spiritual in nature, conversion is spiritual in nature
      * We are not competent to reckon with the suppression of truth
    * Manifests in false worship, epistemological tyranny, corruption of the mind
  * Summary
    * Plurality of creation is one giant revelation
    * Teaches us about creator/creature distinction
