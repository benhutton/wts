# Special Revelation

## What is Special Revelation?

* Bavinck's definition
  * Three irreducible elements
    * Speaker = God
    * What is spoken = God's truth
    * Hearer = Man
  * Underlying premise
    * Naturalist has no place for revelation at all
    * God does not speak or communicate himself
* Bible as Revelation
  * Diverse human authorship
  * Different styles, genres, vocabularies, languages
  * Contrasts with Koran, etc.
  * Bible is distinct in its unfolding of the organic history of revelation
  * Extraordinary unity
  * Revelation and Record of Revelation
    * Words about those acts are an interpretation/explanation of the acts
  * Scriptures explain, interpret, and fortify the revelatory deeds of God
  * Can properly see the Bible as redemptive-historical revelation
    * Occurs over history
    * Contains redemptive data
* Special Revelation and General Revelation
  * We reflect that God is a relational communicating God
  * Something unique about verbal revelation
    * Clarity and specificity that outdoes the clarity and specificity of general revelation
    * Inherently authoritative because it is God's revelation

## Prelapsarian Special Revelation

* Two-fold division of special revelation
  * Vos - "The Eschatology of the Old Testament"
  * God created, sought out fellowship, and gave verbal instruction to Adam and Eve, calling for their full trust in him as their creator and guide
* Pre-lapsarian context of special revelation
  * Biblical theology, eschatology
  * Vos 
    * "a whole chapter of eschatology is written before sin"
    * "There is an absolute end posited for the universe before and apart from sin"
  * Destination for creation: "If you do not eat of this, you will surely live"
  * End of the universe in terms of God's glory being fully manifest is embedded in creation prior to the fall
  * God had a purpose of his creation to attain a state of glory even without the fall
    * God's purpose for this was not to be attained in the first Adam, but in the last
  * History is a line, not a circle
    * There is an end, and this end was in view prior to the fall
* Covenantal Words in Eden (God speaks...)
  * Eat of every tree but one, because if he does he'll die
  * Character of prelapse special revelation
    * Verbal
    * Religious & Relational
    * Necessary
    * Additional to the organism of revelation in the garden
      * God expressing what is not self-evident
  * God's purposes in history have always involved his explicit communication to his people
  * Biblical theology scolars reject the Bible having commands by appealing that it is a narrative and narrative doesn't have commands

## Postlapsarian Special Revelation

* Bible as redemptive
* Transition between Genesis 2 and Genesis 3
  * Man moves from friendship and fellowship 
  * What Adam anticipates with the arrival of God is the wrath and fury of eschatalogical judgment
  * Soul is anguished, "my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
  * Revelation 6:15-17
* Nature of post-fall revelation
  * Gracious by its very existence (not just condescending)
  * God's wrath is deferred in a critical way because of his purposes for earth
  * Personal
  * Character of that revelation...

## The contrast in redemptive revelation (in Hebrews)

* Hebrews 1
  * Summary significance
    * Has in view the entirety of post-fall revelatory history 
    * Laying out a Biblical philosophy of history - how we are to understand an interpret history
    * The speaker is God - we are accountable before God and must respond to him because he is the speaker
    * Hebrews is a letter of exhortation. It is the reason for the existence of the letter. Can accidentally lose the hortatory function in the midst of the deep theology.
      * paranesis = exhortation
  * Main point is revelation
    * verb is laleo
    * Point? God has spoken
  * Diversity of communication in the past
    * polumeros kai polutropos - many ways and many times
    * Iterative character, long gaps of time, not a constant
    * Historical contrast - "times past" contrasted with "these last days"
      * Two stage view of history
      * Consistent theme of the NT - the last days are already inaugurated, not just in the future
    * Covenantal contrast - old covenant fading away as we enter into the new convenant
      * Discontinuity historically
      * Continuity of covenantal progression
    * Contrast between the revelation that is anticipatory given through the prophets and the revelation that is final, given in the Son
* Hebrews 2
  * Law was mediated by angels
  * There was accountability to Old Covenant revelation - retribution for transgression
  * Revelation of God in his Son shows redemption
  * Continued use of laleo
  * Use of a fortiori argument - lesser to greater
    * If OC was reliable, the NC is even greater still
    * Angels vs. the Lord
* Hebrews 3
  * We are called to "hold fast" to our confidence - called to respond
  * laleo again, speaker is God
  * Moses is contrasted to Christ. Moses if faithful as a servant, but Christ is faithful as a son.
    * Moses, as servant, serves to make the house ready for the arrival of the son, Christ
    * There are not two houses. Moses is a servant in the same house in which Christ is son.
    * If it were not for Christ, Moses has no purpose whatsoever.
  * Sweep of redemptive history
  * Rigorous organic continuity
    * Shows organic connectedness of all tributaries of prophetic revelation flowing toward the same destination, Jesus Christ the Son
  * House is not only the only house, but the final house - the consummate end of God's revelation

## Special Revelation as Unified History

* Explicitly an historical unity
  * Inviolable connection between the theology of Hebrews and the drama that is unfolding on the stage of history
  * Not like Koran - Allah has a copy in his bedside table and dropped it from heaven
  * Not abstract revelation
  * Very important temporality

## Special Revelation as Redemptive-*Historical*

* Scripture lays out a non-cyclical view of history
  * Greek philosophers viewed history as essentially circular - kingdoms rise and fall, rise and fall, etc.
    * Leads to skeptical depressed view of life
  * Augustine: history is not a circle but a line
    * Beginning, end, and connectedness because God designed it and works in it, and will deliver it to his intended end
    * Kingdoms rise and fall to point to the inadequacy of human kingdoms and to point to the adequacy of the Kingdom of God
* History has meaning because God is at work
  * Meaning if found only in the Son
