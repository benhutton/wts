# Lecture 16 - Biblical and Systematic Theology

## What is ST? What is BT?

* Biblical theology - appreciates the historical dimension of scripture - diachronic

* Contemporary landscape
  * ST has been attacked lately because scripture has been attacked - if scripture is not an organic whole, then there is nothing systematic about it so we don't need to do that
* The Title and Systematic Theology
  * What is the Bible?
  * Bible and its Unity
    * There is a unity to scripture because the Spirit of God is the primary author
    * Linguistic
    * Redemptive historical
    * Divine unity
    * Significance of this unity
      * Scripture interprets scripture
  * Method of Systematic Theology
    * Done properly when grounded in exegesis and BT
    * Often has been dominated by philosophical speculation
    * We want to be radically nonspeculative, depending on scripture interpreting scripture
    * Categories are not arbitrary - derived from the text of scripture
