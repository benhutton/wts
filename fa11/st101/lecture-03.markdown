# Theology & Prolegomena

## What is "Prolegomena"

  * "Prolegomena" = "the things said first"
  * Matters of epistemology and ontology
  * Should we approach the notion of theology with certain assumptions that are not theological?
  * Do we use a-theological tools to carry out the task of theology?
  * Do we need philosophy to do the work of theology?
  * Are the prolegomena pre-theological?
  * In most systems of thought: 
    * Starting point is common reason or logic, and theology is built on top of that
    * Logical and epistemological foundations cross time and culture
    * Classical apologetic method
    * Dimensionalism: Personal = Faith, Impersonal = Matter
    * Comes from Immanuel Kant
    * Thomistic and broadly evangelical approach:
      * Foundation of logic
      * Certain things that we share rational, believer and unbeliever
      * Epistemological common ground
      * Foundation is pre-theological
      * Theology relies on reason, logic, philosophy

## Prolegomena Revisited

  * The foundations for theology itself are theological
  * Because we are created beings, made by God, in his world, everything we do is theological.  We live corem deo - before the face of God
  * Psalm 1 + 2 provide and introduction to all the Psalms.  Look at the other Psalms, keeping mind Psalm 1 + 2.
    * Underlying Psalm 1 is the reality that we all live before the face of God - no way to escape it
  * Nothing that we do can be divided between personal and impersonal because everything is before the face of God
  * God is at the beginning - presupposing God
  * "pro" doesn't mean prior to chronological, but primary to
  * There are no thoughts regarding God or anything else that are pre-theological or a-theological
  * We begin with God, and between God and us there is communication
  * Romans 1 - everyone has lived before the face of God and known him, however they may have suppressed that knowledge

## History of Prolegomena

  * Latecomer to theological enterprise
  * Early scholastic developments
    * Questions of theology -> questions of knowledge
    * Not really coming until the Reformation
    * Dunns Scotus
    * William of Ockham
    * Roman Catholicism (Aquinas) - preambula fide - classical apologetics
  * Reformers challenged philosophical presuppositions of medieval scholarship
    * Luther
    * Calvin - starting point of radical distinction between creator and creature
      * God and man are completely separate and ontolotically distinct
      * God condescends to our ability to comprehend
      * "God speaks to us as nannies do to small children" - Dutch theologian
  * Summary
    * Theological controversy leads to theological clarity
    * Questions of prolegomena are interrelated with questions of authority - church sits under scripture, not the other way around
    * Starting point is where God has revealed himself most clearly - in the scriptures

## Prolegomena in Conclusion

  * Not prior, but primary
  * Theology of theology
  * Creator/creature distinction
  * Prolegomenon makes explicit our presuppositions
  * "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"
  * Danger for theologian = attitudinal

## Implications

  * If God's speech is essential for theology...
  * If dependence is critical...
  * If prolegomena is theological
  * What is the principium/starting point for theology?
  * Ansewr = Doctrine of Revelation
