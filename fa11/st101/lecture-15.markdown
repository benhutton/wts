# Lecture 15: Scripture

## Introductory Considerations

* Revelation as the principium of theology
* Scripture as the norming norm
  * Confession is not intended to be the judge of Scripture
  * Scripture is to be the judge of the confession
  * Westminster Divines made clear that if WCF didn't conform with scripture, the WCF must be changed

## The Old Testament on the Old Testament

* Claims of the OT
  * Authoritative nature of the covenant
    * Covenant is the King speaking to the people
    * Has authority because it is the King speaking
  * Canonical self-consciousness
* Self-witness of the OT
  * "Thus says the Lord" > 370 times
    * Clear sense of authority

## The Old Testament on the New Testament

* There's a clear anticipatory function, pointing forward to Jesus
* Incompletion

## The New Testament on the Old Testament

* Writers recognize their own authority based on authority of the OT
* 2 Timothy 3
  * Baton-passing letter
  * Paul's last extant letter
  * Character of Scripture
    * "Sacred writings" = OT scripture
    * graphe = scripture, entirety of OT canon
    * Grammatical concerns for theopneustos
      * Passive verbal adjective
      * NOT saying that God takes human words and makes them inspiring
      * IS saying that the product (the words) are breathed out by God
    * Meaning of theopneustos
      * Preach the word, because you have nothing else worthwhile to say
      * It is profitable because of what it is, not because of what it does
    * Primary author is the Holy Spirit
    * Scripture as "inspired"
      * Kind of a bad term
      * Better to be "expired" - breathed out (instead of breathed into)
      * Paul has in view a product, not a process
* Scope of inspiration (expiration)
  * pasa graphe
  * Scripture extensively (plenary) and intensively (verbal) inspired
  * Not sufficient to say that the ideas of scripture are true, because ideas are directly tethered to words
  * Truths of scripture by good and necessary consequence come from the words of scripture

## Contemporary Debate

* Garden of Eden questioned the reliability, trustworthiness, sufficiency, necessity of the word of God
* Stephen T. Davis (1977) - tries to separate inerrancy and infallibility (but redefines infallibility)
  * Error or scientific imprecision?
  * Argued for dimensionalized view of scripture - believe about some things but not about others
* Chicago Statement (1978)
  * International Congress on Biblical Inerrancy
  * Infallible
  * Inerrant
* Rogers and McKim proposal (1979)
  * Tried to show inerrancy was new, post-Enlightenment
* John Woodbridge (1982)
  * Term inerrancy might be new but the concept is not
  * Shared by the people of God for all of time
  * The Bible is true because God is true
* Current scholarship
  * Allert, Sparks, McGowan, Ehrman, Enns, others...
  * Ehrman is trying to engage the public, writes winsomely, has serious errors
  * Some issues in debate:
    * God vs. Bible - cannot attribute nature of scripture with the character of God
    * History vs. Theology - the Bible is about theology, not history
    * OT vs. NT  
* It may sometimes be difficult to take our stand frankly by the side of Christ and his apostles. It will always be found safe. - Warfield

## 2 Peter 1:16-21

* Context - 1:12-15, 2:1
  * Peter is on his way out, getting ready to depart this earth
  * Talking about reminding and remembering 3 times - feeding sheep in his presence and absence
  * Peter in his reminding is focusing the church on where they need to settle their rest and trust in his absence
  * Concerned that the elect might not be led astray
    * Infiltration of false teaching
* Character of Apostolic Teaching - 1:16-18
  * Mount of Transfiguration
  * Reminiscent of Mount Sinai
  * Apostles as recipients, stewards
  * Apostles as eyewitnesses, ear witnesses
  * The revelation of Jesus Christ by the Father
  * Substance of apostolic teaching - dunamin kai parousian - power and coming
* Supremacy of the prophetic word
  * 1:19 - kai exomen bebaioteron ton prophetikon logon
  * "made more certain" (NIV) vs. "we have something more sure" (ESV)
  * Contrast between eyewitness experience and something else with a greater level of surety/confidence
  * Don't rely on experience. Peter had the experience of experiences
* The "prophetic word"
  * Old Testament
  * New Testament
  * Center of revelation is Christ
  * The word is not...
    * Private interpretation (1:20)
      * What is written is not authoritative because it is their interpretation (not even an inspired spinning)
    * Numan production (1:21a)
  * The word is...
    * The voice of God (1:21b) - alla hupo pneumatos hagiou pheromenoi elalesan apo theou anthropoi
    * Of divine origin - in direct continuity with the voice of the "megestic glory" - continuity with the word heard on the mountain
  * Confidence must be grounded in the prophetic word, not experience
* Divine/human concursus
  * Participle - pheromenoi
  * Unique apostolic, prophetic authority
  * Human authors - present a vehicles/media through which the HS functions
    * Whether or not the process is mechanistic, the product is fully divine
