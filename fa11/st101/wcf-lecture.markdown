# Lecture 16 - WCF on Scripture

* To the extent we operate with a deficient doctrine of scripture, we lose our footing for believing and proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ
* Using the confession to figure out what scripture says about scripture. Not appealing to it, but starting with it.
* Scripture must be our final epistemological authority at every point, including when it comes to constructing a doctrine of scripture.
  * Scripture is the "norming norm", WCF is the "normed norm".
* Four main attributes
  * Necessity
  * Sufficiency
  * Authority
  * Perspecuity
* Why is WCF1 on scripture? Why start there?
  * Historical Reason - the Irish Articles (1615) began with scripture and served as a model for WCF.
  * Epistemological Reason - scripture is the only divinely given, authoritative, infallible means to know God in a saving way (i.e. our principium cognoscendi)
  * To have a high view of God is to have a high view of his word

## 1.1 The Necessity of Scripture

* Adequacy and Insufficiency of General Revelation
  * Adequate to manifest the goodness, wisdom, and power of God to leave men unexcusable (Romans 1)
  * "The entire universe is a creation and therefore a testimony to God. Nothing is atheistic in the absolute sense."
  * "Light of nature" = inward operation of our mind, cognitive faculties
  * "Unless the answer to the question 'who am I?' has God as part of it, can never know self." - Ferguson
  * "Works of creation and providence" drive home God's existence
  * God is the one doing the revealing. Everything is shot through with the personality of God
  * General revelation is adequate to display God's glory and render us inexcuseable
  * General revelation is revelatory but not restorative
* Necessity and Finality of inscripturated Special Revelation
  * Can make us wise unto salvation
  * Presupposes that we are covenant breakers
  * Necessity of scripture is not necessary in and of itself. God was not constrained to give it to us.
  * Necessary to do what God made it to do
  * Scripture transmits to us and preserves for us the revelatory record of God's redemptive words and deeds in history
  * Forces waging against revelation, would corrupt and obscure the Gospel had it not been written down
    * Corruption of the flesh
    * The malice of Satan
    * The malice of the world
  * God is not bound to the scriptures, but he has bound us to them (Turretin)
  * Saving purposes in history reached their climax in the person and work of Jesus Christ, so revelation has reached its terminus in the scripture
    * Left wing "inner light" movement of radical Anabaptists (dreams, visions, special prophecy)
    * Right wing Roman Catholic "new revelation" via binding traditions, councils, the pope

## 1.2-3 The Doctrine of Canonicity

* WCF includes a list of the 66 books of the Bible
  * Roman Catholics had included the apocrypha in the council of Trent
  * Don't even give it the status of "pious reading" like the Anglicans do
  * The reason to separate these is the doctrine of inspiration - what matters is that its inspired
* Reason to hold to different canon is authority
  * RC Magesterium claimed the right to determine the canon
    * "Scripture exists because the church exists"
  * Because scripture is inspired, the canonical books are not _chosen_ to be the word of God but are _recognized_ to be the word of God
    * "Scriptures create the church"
* The scriptures are self-attesting/self-authenticating
  * Thus scripture, which is the first principle in the supernatural order, is known by itself and has no need of arguments derived from without, to be known to us. (Turretin)
  * Scripture's authority with respect to itself depends on Scripture. (Bavinck)
    * A document is not authoritative because it claims to be
    * Authority derives from the God who wrote it
  * The phrase 'the authority of scripture' must be understood to be shorthand for 'the authority of God as he speaks through scripture' (Timothy Ward)
  * To say that the Bible is the absolute authority for man is also to say that God is the absolute authority for man. (Van Til)

## 1.4 The Authority of Scripture

* Authority does not depend on testimony of any man or church
* Supreme authority rests in the fact that it is the Word of God
  * The Bible reflects the character of God
* Apostles were aware that they were producing a divine work
  * 1 Thess 2
  * 1 Cor 14:37
  * 1 John 4:6

## 1.5 The Way We Come to Believe the Bible

* External factors
  * Testimony of the church
* Internal factors
  * Unity
  * Majesty of style
* Used by the HS to lead us to a recognition that the Bible is the word of God
  * Means by themselves will not bring us to the point of trust
  * Must be the sovereign work of the spirit to give us this knowledge
  * HS is the necessary and efficient cause for us to see what is objectively present in the word of God
  * Does NOT transform the scriptures (neo-orthodoxy) but transforms us
  * The HS uses the scriptures to convince us of the scriptures

## 1.6 The Sufficiency of Scripture

* Not everything the Spirit has deposited in scripture is revealed there. Many things must be deduced from scripture by good and necessary consequence
* The Spirit who inspired the words must bring them home to us in saving illumination
* Does not mean that the Bible speaks with decisive clarity in all matters
  * Scripture applies to all areas even if it doesn't speak directly to all areas

## 1.7 The Perspicuity of Scripture

* Not all things are equally plain/clear
  * There are difficult passages in the Bible (2 Peter 3:16)
* Not everyone will equally apprehend what is clear
* The things necessary for salvation are clear
* Essential but not exhaustive clarity of scripture
* Does NOT deny:
  * The legitimacy of commentaries
  * The need for teachers (Eph 4:11)
  * The reality of difficult texts (2 Peter 3:16)
  * The presence of mystery (e.g., Trinity)

## 1.8 The Preservation and Translation of Scripture

* Immediate inspiration of the original manuscripts
* Original languages are the final court of appeal
* Textual variations in extant manuscripts don't mess with any major doctrines
* The sum of the texts gives the original word of God
* Must translate the Bible into the common language of the people
  * Scripture is accesssible to everyone

## 1.9 The Interpretation of Scripture

* The infallible rule of interpretation of Scripture is the Scripture itself: and therefore, when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one), it must be searched and known by other places that speak more clearly.
* Often NT gives infallible commentary on OT (Hebrews, for example)
* Scriptures present a coherent, organic whole because it is authored by an integrated God
* Scripture is internally coherent, not conflicting
  * One in meaning and sense
* There is always more truth to break forth from the word of God
* This requires divine authorship

## 1.10 The Holy Spirit in the Scriptures as Supreme Judge

* In all religious controversies, who or what is the final court of appeal?
  * HS speaking in the scriptures
  * HS is supreme judge over all councils, creeds, writers, expositions




* Does this mean that things that are not clear are not necessary for salvation
