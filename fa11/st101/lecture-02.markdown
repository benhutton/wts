# How have people over the course of history gone about approaching big philosophical questions?

  * Generational approach: "I believe what I believe because my parents believed it"
    * No sense of ultimate reality, but reality is culturally conditioned
    * Ancestor worship or materialism
  * Traditional approach: "Dominant religion groups have formed conclusions and I adopt these conclusions because of where I live"
    * Reformers were challenging this
    * Found in some sectors of post-reformation protestantism, in hyper-confessional churches
  * Rational approach: "I am not merely a product of parents and tradition, but I have some competency to judge for myself and trust in my rational cognitive competencies"
    * Individualistic and self-confident
    * Dominant in post-enlightenment times
    * Materialism/philosophical monism: everything is a product of chemical and biological processes
    * Minds are taught to question all things (other than what is observable and repeatable in a scientific model)
    * Stanley Fish - text doesn't have meaning until I bring meaning to the text. The product of meaning is a function of the reader (in terms of his community), not the author.
    * Post-modernism - truth begins and ends with us
    * Applied to the Bible - only has meaning based on interpretive grid I bring to the text
  * Experiental or existential approach: "My experience with God is what religion really is"
    * Schleiermacher - religion is the sense of dependence that's shared by everybody everywhere.  Proper religion is defined by everyone's own experience.
    * Autonomy of experience - "what does the Bible mean to me?"
    * Relience upon emotional sensibilities
  * Irrationalism - "There is absolutely no absolute truth whatsoever"
    * Meaning is reduced to my own understanding
    * No meta-narrative or grand story or grand purpose
    * Nobody can ultimately stand here - doesn't work for your monthly paycheck
  * Postfoundationalism
    * Attempt to move beyond postmodernism
    * No foundations other than that there are no foundations

  Men suppress the truth in many different ways.
  Each view begins with the human realm and seeks to arrive at a way to answer the ultimate questions.
  Is there not a more certain basis for belief?
  Are we left merely with the speculative capacity of the human mind? Is theology merely a form of human philosophy and metaphysics, and hence a product of human ingenuity?
  Is the task of theology simply for the weak of mind and heart, or simply for the philosophically and metaphysically curious?
  Is there not a more ultimate basis for these questions?

# The possibility of Theology

## What is Theology?

  * theos = God
  * logos = word
  * from "God" and "lego" = "to speak"
  * Speaking words about God
  * Humanity speaking about God

## Meta Problems for Theology

  * How do you know what you know is the right thing to know? Epistemology
  * Creator/creature distinction
  * God is infinite and we are finite
  * Fallenness
  * Noetic effects of the fall - effect of sin on our mind - our thinking is corrupted
  * If we are finite and fallen, then anything we say about God would come short of who he is
  * Humanly created theology is a form of idolatry

## Conclusion

  * Ground of theology will not be found in experience, tradition, reason, or human institutions
  * Will not come from articulation of our own sense of story
  * Left where we started, with a dependence upon God
  * We are dependent upon God for our theology not to be idolatry
  * Theology requires that God must speak in order for us to know him correctly
  * Theology is dependent upon God's self-disclosure, speaking in a way in which we will understand
  * Physical dependence is a portrayal of our ultimate dependence
  * We are receptor, not creator
  * We are doing recreative reconstruction, seeking to speak God's thoughts after him
  * God accomodates himself to us in language that is understandable

# Conclusion

  * God must speak for me to know and to speak
  * God speaks voluntarily - he didn't owe it to us
  * The very fact of God's revelation is kind
  * God must theologize in order for me to theologize
  * God has to tell us what is true
  * Get Bavinck's Reformed Dogmatics
  * God is both the subject and the object of theology
  * He is both the speaker and the one spoken about
  * He is both the revealer and the revealed
  * God is the starting point for all things
    * Theology
    * Worldview
    * Hermeneutics
