# Lecture 7 - Theology & Epistemology, Part 2

## Central role of Jesus Christ (John 1, Colossians 1-2, Ephesians 1, Luke 10)
  * Christ "in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden" (Col 2:3)
    * Christ as dispenser, dispense - revelation from and to the Son
  * 1 Corinthians 1:18-2:16
    * Context of Crisis
    * The antidote to the crisis: theology
      * Immense practicality of deep and profound theology
      * Don't just answer questions, but tell people what their real problems are
      * What people perceive as their itch is not what really needs to be scratched
      * In a sense, goal is to be immensely irrelevant
      * God defines relevance, and he directs us not only to the answers, but to the real problems
