# Lecture 7 - Theology & Epistemology, Part 2

## Central role of Jesus Christ (John 1, Colossians 1-2, Ephesians 1, Luke 10)
  * Christ "in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden" (Col 2:3)
    * Christ as dispenser, dispense - revelation from and to the Son
  * 1 Corinthians 1:18-2:16
    * Context of Crisis
    * The antidote to the crisis: theology
      * Immense practicality of deep and profound theology
      * Don't just answer questions, but tell people what their real problems are
      * What people perceive as their itch is not what really needs to be scratched
      * In a sense, goal is to be immensely irrelevant
      * God defines relevance, and he directs us not only to the answers, but to the real problems
    * Fee: "Who in the name of wisdom would have dreamed that up?" "Who in the name of wisdom would have chosen you to be the new people of God?" "Who in the name of wisdom would have come like this?"
  * Pauline Epistemology
    * Clash between worldly and divine wisdom
      * Clear categorical distinction
      * Unbelieving epistemology antithetical to believing epistemology
    * Analysis of worldly wisdom
      * "Worldly" not used in a spatial sense, but in an analytical sense
      * A system of unbelief operating in rebellious man, in the so-called wise
    * Jesus Christ, the Center of wisdom
      * Contrasts the folly of the Cross and its preaching to worldly wisdom
      * Christ *is* our wisdom
      * Connection between soteriology and epistemology
        * Effect upon our minds in the all-sufficient work of Jesus Christ
      * Wisdom is not an intellectual or cognitive matter, but a personal matter
      * Christ is the ultimate epistemological commitment (1:23-25)
        * Christ is the answer to the Jews who seek signs
        * ... to the Greeks who seek wisdom
      * Consistent with Romans 1
        * 2 types of people - covenent rebellion and covenent submission
      * Wisdom as a matter of God's revelation (2:6-10)
        * Wisdom of the Cross is not humanly conjured up, but revealed by God in the scriptures
        * Wisdom of God is beyond autonomous grasps of humanity, beyond philosophical or intellectual or empirical pursuit
      * Christ is anchor of human thought properly exercised
    * Revelation as Trinitarian (2:10b-15)
      * Interplay of the Father + Spirit with the Son
      * Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God
        * Omni-competent investigator with comprehensive knowledge
        * Existence and interpretation are co-extensive in the person of God (Van Til)
        * Spirit = "the personal principle of God's self-knowledge"
        * We have been given this very spirit
        * Sovereign benefactor of **Spiritual** understanding
          * Spirit is the one who gives us understanding
        * There is, in evangelicalism, a division between the Spirit and the Word. This fails to realize that the Word is the Spirit's Word.
    * Implications for knowledge
      * No epistemological common ground between believer and nonbeliever
        * Two positions, two types of men
          * pneumatikos - "Spiritual" - we are spiritual people because we possess the Spirit of God (not because we have a spirit)
            * We are enabled by this spirit to do something that apart from him we would not be able to do - have appropriate understanding
            * We are NOT now omni-competent, but we can think rightly
          * psuchikos - "natural"
            * Noetic effect of sin: cannot understand
              * Unable to understand the world rightly, and he wants it that way (Romans 1)
            * Calvin: "Like an ass at a concert"
    * Believer's knowledge more fully considered
      * Knows "all things"
        * No abstract thought - only people who think
        * People who think are either in rebellion or receiving the Spirit
        * Spirit gives an understanding about all things in a way in which there is no sphere that is untouched
        * Indispensible comprehension of all things
        * We know all things in an entirely different way
      * Receptive, re-creative intellectual freedom
        * Our minds have been opened by the Spirit to see things as they really are (unbelievers are closed-minded)
        * Freed from moral, intellectual, and epistemological bondage
      * Soteriological Context for Epistemology
        * Spirit of Christ (the sovereign king) is ours
        * Christian heart and mind
    * Unbeliever's knowledge more fully considered
      * Absolute ethical, doxological antithesis
        * When the unbeliever comes to right conclusions, those conclusions are in fact right.
          * Can come to right conclusions because they cannot fully surpress the truth
          * Koran contains some true things, because Mohammed will say things truly despite himself
      * Genuine knowledge, "as far as it goes" (Van Til)...
      * Nonchristians operate on stolen capital - they take and use Christian principles
      * Knowing & not knowing: Romans 1 & sexual perversion
        * There is an intimacy about knowledge
        * Intimacy of marital relationship is designed to point us to God the creator
        * Pleasure in sexual perversion is empty and false
        * A believing single person has a better understanding of sexuality than an unbelieving immoral person
      * The imago Dei
        * The sensus deitatus
        * Distortion
        * Impossible to deny being in God's image
        * Can carry out functional atheism, but at every point God speaks and first and foremost the atheism is a willful, ethical one
        * Point of contact - unbeliever can do good research, come up with good conclusions
          * Classic, Arminian view - logic as shared
          * Never on common ground epistemologically, but psychologically
          * Every unbeliever knows God (we know this about people that they may not even consciously know themselves)
        * Paul says both that an unbeliever knows God (as judge) and doesn't know God (as Redeemer)
      * What does the unbeliever know?
        * Does he know? Yes AND No.
        * Knows but resists that knowledge, so knowledge is clouded and distorted
        * Romans 1:20-21 
          * Knowing - all men know God, and know the one true God. Man cannot be self-conscious without being God-conscious
          * Not knowing - warped, corrupted, surpressed knowledge. Colored glasses (Van Til)
          * "We cannot intelligently think away God's existence"
          * "Knowledge of God's will tells him how to disobey God." - Frame
        * Points and implications:
          * Accountability
          * Understanding - those who reject God are able to glean considerable knowledge about their world and themselves
          * Rebellion & misunderstanding - epistemological rebels
            * "Unbelievers can very well count, but they cannot account for their counting." - Van Til
          * Cognitive impossibilities
            * There are things qualitatively and quantitatively that there is no way for unbelievers to know
            * Cannot know the grace of God
            * Islam has no genuine provision of redemption
          * Cognitive instability
            * Our stability is not grounded in our system, but grounded in our Savior. There is a system of thought that comes clearly from scripture, but it is not abstract - it is a Christ-centered revelation from God.
            * Unbeliever will necessarily operate in a cognitive instability
          * Ministry by the Omni-Competent Spirit in a willfully incompetent world
            * Even if we can't answer every question thrown our way, there are answers somewhere
            * And behind the questions is a heart that is desperately wicked and seeking to suppress the truth


* 2+2=4 because of who God is and for no other reason
