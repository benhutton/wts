# Lecture 14 - Special Revelation, Part 2

## Special Revelation centered on Christ

* Revelation as historic unity pointing to Christ
  * Scripture as clear unity with diversity (Heb 1:1 - "In many times, many ways, God has spoken")
  * God as speaker brings revelation together with unity
  * John 5:39-47 - if you read Moses and you do not see Jesus, you do not read Moses correctly. There is a culpability for missing the OT's Christ-centeredness
* The organic character of Christ-centeredness
  * Content & meaning is Christ
  * Christian "reading" of the text
  * Jesus is NOT coming and hijacking the OT, importing a Christian reading of it
  * He's showing what is already there
* Christ's interpretation of the OT
  * Luke 24:25-27, 44-45 (After the resurrection, disciples walking to Emmaus. Jesus appears and they don't recognize him...)
  * Jesus goes through entire OT and is explicit about the scope of his presence in the OT
  * "Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures"
    * Jesus changes them, not the scriptures
    * Helps them to see scripture for what it is
  * Necessary explanation
  * Fully present in OT, fully necessary to explain
  * 1 Peter 1:10-11 - OT prophets enjoyed the presence of the spirit of Christ as they wrote, anticipating the suffering of Christ and the glories that followed
  * The incarnate Christ (1 Cor 15:3-4)
    * Christ died in accordance with the Scriptures
* Christ as the FINAL revelation
  * Not just the latest word, but the last word, the consummation of revelation
  * Christ is the center and the end point
  * No subsequent prophet
  * Hebrews 9:26-28
