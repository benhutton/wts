# Lecture 14 - Special Revelation, Part 2

## Special Revelation centered on Christ

* Revelation as historic unity pointing to Christ
  * Scripture as clear unity with diversity (Heb 1:1 - "In many times, many ways, God has spoken")
  * God as speaker brings revelation together with unity
  * John 5:39-47 - if you read Moses and you do not see Jesus, you do not read Moses correctly. There is a culpability for missing the OT's Christ-centeredness
* The organic character of Christ-centeredness
  * Content & meaning is Christ
  * Christian "reading" of the text
  * Jesus is NOT coming and hijacking the OT, importing a Christian reading of it
  * He's showing what is already there
* Christ's interpretation of the OT
  * Luke 24:25-27, 44-45 (After the resurrection, disciples walking to Emmaus. Jesus appears and they don't recognize him...)
  * Jesus goes through entire OT and is explicit about the scope of his presence in the OT
  * "Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures"
    * Jesus changes them, not the scriptures
    * Helps them to see scripture for what it is
  * Necessary explanation
  * Fully present in OT, fully necessary to explain
  * 1 Peter 1:10-11 - OT prophets enjoyed the presence of the spirit of Christ as they wrote, anticipating the suffering of Christ and the glories that followed
  * The incarnate Christ (1 Cor 15:3-4)
    * Christ died in accordance with the Scriptures
* Christ as the FINAL revelation
  * Not just the latest word, but the last word, the consummation of revelation
  * Christ is the center and the end point
  * No subsequent prophet
  * Hebrews 9:26-28

## Special Revelation as Diverse

* Word and Deed (Heb 1:1)
  * Part of the diversity is the interface of word and deed
  * Contrast in ages and means
    * "In Son" (anarthrous) is a qualitative elevation of the revelation
  * Theophany and the *Immanuel* Principle
    * Miracle and prophecy are theophanic - a revelation of God
    * Revelation of God shows us who he is - "God with us"
    * Various times in Word & Deed
    * All of OT revelation has anticipatory component - subeschatalogical restlessness
    * *Immanuel* principle points us to Jesus
    * Theophany comes to fruition in the incarnate Son of God
  * Scripture's covenantal Christological, Covenantal Unity...
    * The meaning of the Exodus is given to the people of God in a way that points to the person of Jesus
    * Scripture as revelation is tethered to the revelatory dimension of God's acts
    * Timelessness of it is grounded in the timeliness of it
    * The books of the Bible are given in particular occasions
    * Not just a handbook of philosophical or theological reflection
    * Not everything in the OT points to Christ in the same way
    * All revelation properly understood is Christocentric in its nature
* Word and Deed revelation bring entire redemptive history together
  * Acts of God in history need God's interpretation
    * We know significance of life, death, resurrection of Jesus because God had revealed it to us
  * The God of revelation is the God of history
  * Avoiding errors:
    * Word only - platonic - spiritual truth that is timeless in nature
    * Deed only - not only the acts that are revelatory
  * We would not have true access to the redemptive acts of God if not for God's word that explains it to us
* History of Redemption Illustrated
  * River - all of the tributaries are feeding into a larger flow of the unfolding of God's purposes, coming to a head in the person of Jesus
  * Rings of tree - don't have the outer ring if you don't have the inner ring
    * Early scripture is seed
* Special Revelation's Christocentric Integrity (Romans 1:1-7)
  * Jesus suffered, then was glorified
  * All the prophets spoke of this
  * Center of Revelation = Jesus
  * History of Revelation = promise, fulfillment
* The Gospel is not a formula
  * We sometimes try to define the Gospel in terms of our response to the Gospel
* Cessation of Special Revelation
  * Character of Revelation
    * Revelation as iterative, epochal
    * Revelation as Christological
    * Revelation as eschatological
    * Revelation as Pneumatological (John 16:13-15)
      * Trinitarian dimension to revelation, economically
      * Spirit declares the things of Jesus
      * HS = Spirit of Christ
  * Hebrews 1:1-2 revisited
    * Christ as the endpoint of revelation
    * Apostles have a unique function of bearing out the interpretation of the work of the Son
    * HS applies that revelation to future generations
    * HS will never do anything other than point us back to Christ
* Evangelicalism & Roman Catholicism
  * When you believe the HS speaks today, you begin to rely on some additional authority
  * Multiple strands of authority
  * Church says, "I want God's Word + something else", then the "something else" eclipses God's Word
