# Theology & Epistemology

* Epistemology = how we know what we know
  * Not pre-theological

## Christ the Creator
  * Creation and redemption are comnplementary concepts
  * John 1:1-3 - Jesus has made all things.  Scope is total
  * "Prejudiced" witness (Van Til) - there is nothing that we can look at that does not connect us back to God
  * Intelligibility of any fact presupposes God
  * Colossians 1:15-20, 2:1-5, 8-10
    * Creator of material and invisible things
    * Agency of Creation - If it were not for the Son of God, it would not exist
    * Purpose of Creation - all things are oriented to him
    * Sustenance of Creation - There is no molecule that holds to another molecule apart from the direct intervention of the Son of God.
    * Christ is the source & epicenter of all things
    * To speak of or understand anything apart from appreciating the Son of God as creator and sustainer of all things is to speak in rebellious abstraction.
    * The Son of God is both the revealer and the revealed.
    * All studies, whatever the field, ought to lead us to worship
    * Christ is the first principle of cognition
    * Christ is the eschatological consummator of knowledge
    * Summary
      * Human thought is contingent and derivative thought
      * In Christ are hidden all wisdom and knowledge
      * Nothing in Christ's redemptive work that ought not draw us to worship
      * Christ the source, epicenter, consummator of all knowledge
      * All human endeavors must be seen in their Christological light
      * Epistemological imperative
      * Exercise our lives and thoughts in a way that he might become preeminent
  * The point?
    * Christ is the Center of all thought
    * "Because the universe is God's creation, it is also his revelation and self-manifestation. There is not an atom of the world that does not reflect his deity." - Bavinck
    * Christ: Inauguration of His Kingdom

## Christ the King
  * Luke 10:21-22
  * Holy Spirit confirms and attests to the work of the Son
  * Old Testament anticipates the last days. New Testament is the inauguration of them.
    * We are living in the last days.
    * HS is confirmation
  * Trinitarian: Son is praying to the Father and rejoicing in the HS
    * Distinguishes the Christian faith from any other
  * Revelation as Divine
    * Revelatory work of Father & Son: apokalupto
    * Revelation as sovereignly dispensed
