# Theology & Epistemology

* Epistemology = how we know what we know
  * Not pre-theological

## Christ the Creator
  * Creation and redemption are comnplementary concepts
  * John 1:1-3 - Jesus has made all things.  Scope is total
  * "Prejudiced" witness (Van Til) - there is nothing that we can look at that does not connect us back to God
  * Intelligibility of any fact presupposes God
  * Colossians 1:15-20, 2:1-5, 8-10
    * Creator of material and invisible things
    * Agency of Creation - If it were not for the Son of God, it would not exist
    * Purpose of Creation - all things are oriented to him
    * Sustenance of Creation - There is no molecule that holds to another molecule apart from the direct intervention of the Son of God.
    * Christ is the source & epicenter of all things
    * To speak of or understand anything apart from appreciating the Son of God as creator and sustainer of all things is to speak in rebellious abstraction.
    * The Son of God is both the revealer and the revealed.
    * All studies, whatever the field, ought to lead us to worship
    * Christ is the first principle of cognition
    * Christ is the eschatological consummator of knowledge
    * Summary
      * Human thought is contingent and derivative thought
      * In Christ are hidden all wisdom and knowledge
      * Nothing in Christ's redemptive work that ought not draw us to worship
      * Christ the source, epicenter, consummator of all knowledge
      * All human endeavors must be seen in their Christological light
      * Epistemological imperative
      * Exercise our lives and thoughts in a way that he might become preeminent
  * The point?
    * Christ is the Center of all thought
    * "Because the universe is God's creation, it is also his revelation and self-manifestation. There is not an atom of the world that does not reflect his deity." - Bavinck
    * Christ: Inauguration of His Kingdom

## Christ the King
  * Luke 10:21-22
  * Holy Spirit confirms and attests to the work of the Son
  * Old Testament anticipates the last days. New Testament is the inauguration of them.
    * We are living in the last days.
    * HS is confirmation
  * Trinitarian: Son is praying to the Father and rejoicing in the HS
    * Distinguishes the Christian faith from any other
  * Revelation as Divine
    * Revelatory work of Father & Son: apokalupto
      * Reveals what is otherwise hidden
    * Revelation as sovereignly dispensed
      * Revealed by the "good pleasure" of the Father
        * Delights in revealing his will
        * Revelation is gracious
      * God is in fact speaking, not a mere human
      * God hides and reveals
      * God's self-disclosure is absolutely free - not coerced
        * Father and Son share a will
      * Isaiah 57:15
        * Revelation is not for the proud, haughty, and self-competent
        * It is for those who are lowly, like children
    * Revelation is necessary
      * Without it we would be damned
      * Must reveal himself as redeemer
      * Without divine revelation, we would not know what we need to know
      * We are wholely dependent on revelation
      * We cannot attain to an understanding of God through our own intellectual competency
  * Revelation as the total source of knowledge
    * The "tota" of revelation: What are "these things" (Luke 20:21)?
    * No immediate reference to the tauta
    * The contextual clarity
      * The Sending (Luke 10:1-12)
      * The Cosmic Battle (Luke 10:13-20)
        * Treading on serpents (the garden)
      * The redemptive-historical blessing (Luke 10:23-24)
    * The scope of tauta
      * Kingdom of God
      * Scope of the Kingdom is the scope of Creation
      * Christ is the creator, redeemer, and consummator of all things
      * Redemptive work of Christ necessarily impinges on every realm of human though
      * Tauta is the panta
      * "In Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge"
  * Christ's Creation and Kingdom in the face of unbelief
    * Intellectual or ethical atheism
      * All intellectual activity is ethical
        * Epistemology is a subset of ethics
        * Thinking is a moral, spiritual, and theological activity
    * Kantian Dimensionalism
      * Rigid bifurcation between religious and nonreligious thought
      * There is no discipline that is disconnected from the Lordship of Jesus Christ
    * Postmodern and the autonomous destruction of Truth
      * Removes the revelatory character of reality
      * No thought can be abstracted from God
      * The knowability of any fact is conditioned upon revelation
  * Human Cognition, God, and Theology
    * No thought can be described as a-theological
    * But isn't this circular?
    * All human thought is a matter of faith
      * Kantian bifurcation
      * Human dependence: Thought requires faith
        * Relying upon experience, deduction, conclusion, input
        * Question is not whether thought is dependant, but on what it ought to depend
        * Two alternatives
          * Trust ourselves
          * Trust divine provision
        * Either case requires trust
    * Two circles of thought
      * Creaturely faith in the creature
        * Critical realism - certain level of competency in our intellects to look at data and draw conclusion with varying degrees of success
        * Any form of knowing that depends on our competency is an act of rebellion that puts us in the place where God belongs
        * Must not abstract our thinking from our creatureliness
        * This is all circular reasoning - begins and ends with self
        * Circle of self-reliance and necessarily antithetical to our creatureliness and acknowledging the limitations of our finiteness and fallenness
        * Critical realism has pervaded biblical studies
          * NT Wright is self-consciously and admittedly a critical realist
      * Creaturely faith in the creator
        * Creature honors his creatureliness and recognizes limitations as a creature
        * Limitations are not only finitude but noetic effects of sin
        * God is the singular objective interpreter of reality
        * Operating in a circle, but it is a circle of blessing
        * Function of creature is to be receptively reconstructive/recreative
      * In neither circle is the circle unprejudiced
      * Question isn't whether or not the reason is circular, but whether I'm in the right circle
      * Gives us certainty - relying on God who is objective and omni-competent
  * Conclusions
    * Without revelation...
      * Theology is speculative and inadequate
      * Theology is misdirected and misdirecting
      * Theology is idolatry, shaping the creator into the image of the creation
      * True theology is an impossibility
    * With revelation
      * We are given clarity
        * Not a product of interpretation, but a property of scripture
        * We can do interpretation because the Bible is clear. Not in order to make the Bible clear
      * We can "do" theology
      * Theology is received, re-creative, re-interpretive
        * Thinking God's thoughts after him
      * We are stewards
        * Servant/Custodian
        * Does not own property he manages
        * Entrusted with its care
        * Sitting under the scriptures is the only proper posture for interpretation, obedience
    * The epistemological triad
      * Orthodoxy - true knowledge/revelation
        * Bible is propositional, but not only propositional
      * Doxology - revelation ought to drive us to worship
      * Orthopraxy - right living/obedience/ethical implications
      * To know more deeply I need to delight more fully. And to delight more fully I need to obey more fully.
