# Theology & Epistemology, Part 4

* Hebrews 4:14: "Let us hold fast our confession"
  * Confession = agreeing with God about what he said about his Son
* Hebrews 10:19-25: "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful."
  * Holding fast confession is the exercise of faith
* Hebrews 11: "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for"
  * Not abstract, but looking forward to the promises of God in his Son

* Theology and Faith
  * Receptivity by Faith
    * Scripture as the principium (source)
    * Faith as the corollary of the principium
    * Only appropriate epistemological posture is faith
  * Faith or Fideism?
    * Schleiermacher: Faith = absolute feeling of dependence. Faith was in faith itself. Feeling of dependence was final court of appeal.
    * Bavinck: [look this up]
  * What is faith?
    * Faith's knowledge: notitia
    * Faith's agreement: assensus
    * Faith's personal reliance: fiducia
      * Calvin: "Faith is a firm and certain knowledge of God's benevolence toward us, founded upon the truth of the freely given promise in Christ, both revealed to our minds and sealed upon our hearts through the HS."
      * "We make them ours by inwardly embracing them."
      * Vos: "Sympathetic absorption in the revelation of God."
  * Biblical Characteristics of Faith
    * Pre-fall and post-fall
      * Serpent shifted faith from the word of God to the individual competency of Adam and Eve
      * Question about God was first leveled at the Word of God
    * Faith and the Holy Spirit
      * Calvin: "Secret" / "Internal" / "Inward" work 
      * HS illumines us to recognize Scripture as God's Word (HS and the self-authenticating Scriptures)
        * HS changes us, not scripture. Scripture doesn't become something, but we are changed to see it for what it is.
    * Faith as a Gift
      * Not a dormant trait in a lazy/sinful/ignorant man. Not a human capacity after the fall.
    * Further clarifications
      * No substance in itself, not grounds but a channel/instrument
      * Comprehensive response of our resurrected state
      * Reorientation of our entire being to where we are in a posture of delighted submission
      * Religious disposition
* Faith according to WCF14
  * 14.1 - The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts; and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the Word: by which also, and by the administration of the sacraments, and prayer, it is increased and strengthend.
    * HS as source
    * Ordinary means is preaching of Word of God
    * Place of sacrements
  * 14.2 - But the principle acts of saving faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace.
    * Just because faith is a gift doesn't mean that faith need not be exercised
    * HS enables us to believe. He doesn't believe for us.
    * God's people follow the shepherd
    * Rest in righteousness but also restlessness for righteousness
    * Object is Christ alone, the ground of faith
    * Calvin: Christ the end of the law - [find this]
  * 14.3 - This faith is different in degrees, weak or strong; may be often and many ways assailed and weakened, but gets the victory; growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through Christ, who is both the author and finisher of our faith.
    * "Lord I believe, help my unbelief"
    * Faith varies in its strength, but not in its object
    * What gives faith its strength is its object
    * Christ is the victor in faith, beginning to end
    * Temptation to find hope in intensity of faith
      * "Has my life lined up with what God has demanded of me?"
      * Formula for spiritual demise
      * What secures our faith is not intensity but Jesus
      * Take eyes off of productivity and fruit and turn eyes onto Jesus
      * As they follow Jesus, fruit will come
* Living faith in the Son of God
  * Faith not Sight... we GET to... its a good thing
  * Faith and Reason... minds are transformed, reason is wholly organically connected to faith. Only in faith do you have true intellectual freedom
  * Faith and Epistemology... true knowledge is saving knowledge (soteriology + epistemology)
  * Faith and Certainty... faith is a pathway to certainty
  * Fruit of Faith... leads to confidence, assurance, courage, rejoicing
  * Faith and Union with Christ... concommitant with our union with Christ
    * Union: mystical, covenantal, vital, filial
  * Faith and works

* Question: how does suffering fit into growing faith?
