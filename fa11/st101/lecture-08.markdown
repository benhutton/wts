# Theology & Epistemology, Part 3

* How God has condescended to communicate to us and what the implications are for our understanding

* Theology and God's self-disclosure
  * God's incomprehensibility - exhaustive knowledge, knows all things infinitely
  * Church Fathers & Luther
    * Augustine: "For if you comprehend, it is not God you comprehend."
      * Our knowledge and God's knowledge are categorically different
    * John of Damascus: apophatic theology
      * We cannot say anything positive about God - we can only speak in negation
    * Essence/Energies
      * Saint Gregory of Palamas (1296-1359): hesychasm
      * Distinction between essence and energies of God
      * Hesychasm - rest, stillness
      * Strong emphasis on the mystical
      * Can only know God's energies - not his essence - and this requires a quite reflection
      * God cannot be known as God, just by his energies
      * Similar to ontological over against the economic realities of the trinity
    * "How do we really know God when he is wholly other" is something the church has wrestled with in different ways
    * Luther: Deus Absconditus - hidden
      * Only know God through "theology of the cross" - in humiliation
      * Reason is inadequate, so perception is off
      * Where we meet God is in humiliation
      * Romans 11 - "his ways are past tracing out. who has known the mind of the Lord"
  * Karl Barth
    * Reacted against immanentism of liberalism
    * Contended that since God is transcendent, he is ultimately inconceivable
    * God = revelation
    * No distinction between God and revelation, so Jesus is the only revelation
    * Scripture is not in itself revelation
    * Human language would bind and reduce God
  * Revelation as condescension
    * God is free to disclose himself
    * God is greater than his revelation
    * Radical distinction between who God is and how he reveals himself, but this shouldn't lead us to skepticism
    * Scripture claims to be the revelation of God, intentionally given
    * God is wholly transcendent but that his not an obstacle to free condescending self-disclosure

* Human Side of Knowing God
  * Knowability is a subset of incomprehensibility
    * Because God is self-contained, he knows all things and all knowledge exists in him
    * Knowledge is inaccessible to us except in condescension
    * Incomprehensibility presupposes that God is known. - Frame
    * Inverse proportionality - the more you know, the more you realize how little you know
    * There is no battle with sin if there is no knowledge of God
    * Isaiah 55:8-9 - "my thoughts are not your thoughts... my ways are higher than your ways"
    * Job 38
  * God's self-revelation and accomodation
    * Univocal knowledge - when we know things, we know them qualitatively and quantitatively as God knows them
      * But then we'd become God... violates creator-creature distinction
    * Equivocal knowledge - we don't know anything truthfully because of the infinite ontological distinction between God and man
    * Analogical knowledge - we know truly but partially
      * Derivative knowledge
      * God has bent over to speak to us as a nanny speaks to a small child
      * Amazing kindness, gracious pursuit
      * Genesis 3 - God gives promise instead of wrath
      * We can know confidently
      * Partial knowledge does not mean inaccurate, but limited
      * Man does not need to know exhaustively in order to know truly and certainly

* Revelation, Analogy, Accomodation
  * Revelation
    * Knowledge of God is from and through God, grounded in his revelation
    * God has revealed to us what he wants us to know
    * Sufficiently clear and adequate
  * Necessity of accomodation
    * God must bend over to accomodate himself to our powers of comprehension
    * God made us, so we can know and understand what we need to know
  * Possibility of accomodation
    * God made us with the sufficient capacity to know him
    * Built into the imago dei is grounds for revelation to accomplish its divine purpose
  * Character of accomodation
  * Accuracy of knowledge
    * Pure, trustworthy
    * No wedge between who God is and his self-disclosure
    * Our trust in the reliability of self-disclosure is grounded in his being
  * Conclusions re: Human Knowledge
    * God has spoken so that we know truly
    * God reveals what he wishes and how he wishes

* God is first speaker
  * Not only are the words his, but they are powerful and efficacious
  * Not only is there power, but what God intends will be accomplished
  * Hope of redemption is grounded in Genesis 1 and 2
  * Redemption is the means by which God will accomplish his purposes
  * Throughout scripture: call for God's people to listen to his word and trust it
  * Faith is built in as dependent creatures - we need to either trust God's word or our perceptive powers

* Character of God, Trustworthiness of Word
  * Evangelical scholarship: God vs. Word
    * Contention: scripture is merely a human witness to a divine act
  * Hebrews 6:19-20
    * Historical argument (v13-16) - remember how God gave Abraham a promise...
      * God employs words; verbal promise
      * Promise linked with Person: absolute reliability
      * Validity of a promise is rooted in character and competency of promiser
      * Faithfulness in history - God did for Abraham exactly what he said he would do
    * Redemptive-Historical Faithfulness (v17-20)
      * God's speaking; verbal oath
      * God's unchangeable oath because of his unchangeable purpose
      * God's purpose is unchangeable because God is unchangeable
      * God demonstrates his faithfulness in all these things in the revelation of the son
