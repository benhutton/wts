# The Christian Worldview

* No one right way to frame it
* Different creeds begin in different places
* The Christian worldview is a reflection of God's unity and trinity

## Christian worldview is from God, through God, and unto God

* Chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever
* Christian theistic method - not just God in general, but the Christian God in specific
* Conversation won't always begin with God, but our position is at the center, God comes first
* Dooyeweerd - "Archimedean point - lever with the proper fixed point could lift anything" - God is that point
  * Everything in life we see through him
  * Everything has meaning b/c of him
  * "Religious ground motive" - precondition
  * In opposition to non-christian ground motive
* God is absolute, the source of his own being

## Creation

* God is the creator
* Distinct, but connected
  * Not a part of the creation (distinct)
  * Imminent, intimately related (connection)
  * Creator/creature distinction
* "The world is established; it cannot be moved" - statement of the solidity of the world (God doesn't erase it or take away its structures)
* God created the world by fiat
* God governs the world by his wisdom and covenental presence
* God made the world good (burden of the first 3 chapters of Genesis)
  * Something has gone wrong, but not because of a basic flaw in the world
  * Angels were created, and some fell too
* Man made in the image of God
  * Triperspectivalism
    * Prophets - name things, science, interpretation
    * Priests - take the world to our benefit in worship, love, and sacrifice to God
    * Kings - rule over the earth, work with it, raise children, declare good and bad
  * Cultural mandate
    * Multiply, subdue the earth, benefit from its fruit
    * We are ontologically after God's image, and we have a call
    * No imperfection in the original creation, but there were things left undone and improvements to be made
    * Original purpose was that obeying God in the simple test of refusing the fruit was meant to bring maturity and lead mankind into consummate bliss
    * "The essence of human beings is to be a passionate vitality" - Bruce Waltke
      * Having drive and interest, along with life, distinguishing us from animals

## Fall

* Adam and Eve rejected the dependence God had required and fell into sin
  * In Genesis 3, can see the nature of the fall
  * Accepted the wrong apologetic from the serpent
  * God is not jealous the way the serpent made it sound
  * Eve rejected a pure dependence upon God
* Sin
  * Active disobedience
  * Lack of conformity to God's will
  * Omission as well as comission
* Dimensions are cosmic; everything was affected
  * Direct relationship with God was troubled
    * "In the day you do it, you will die"
    * Death wasn't complete, because God had mercy, but there was spiritual death and disruption of the fellowship
    * Shame and guilt (go together)
      * Guilt - disobedience
      * Shame - dishonor, loss of standing
  * Human relationships are disrupted
    * Adam blames Eve, Eve blames serpent
    * Murder crept in with Cain and Able
  * Relationship with self
    * Unity of being 
    * "Unite my heart to praise your name" presupposes tha the heart is broken into pieces
    * Totally depraved - scope of depravity is total
      * Noetic effects of sin - logic, reason tainted by sin
  * Relationship with earth
    * Earth has power over us it was never meant to have
    * "You are dust, and to dust you will return"
* Corruption is not of the structures of creation but the direction
  * Marriage, work, worship, creation
  * Marriages go wrong, not the institution of marriage

## Redemption

* Unnecessary mercy, generous gift God never had to give
* Son became man and died a horrible death so that the Son could be the author and finisher of our faith and his righteousness imputed to us and our sin is imputed to him
* Already/not yet
  * Already - just, no longer enemies, being sanctified
  * Not yet - fully sanctified, glorified
* Next major event is the second coming
* Redemption follows along the lines of how it would have gone had Adam and Eve not sinned
  * Tree of life
* Some poeple think the Great Commission abrogates the Cultural Mandate
  * Instead, its an extension - we not only multiply and fill the earth with people and culture, but with Christians

# Implications of Worldview Thinking

## Common Grace

* There are benefits and restraints that God proffers on the world outside of the narrow process of redemption
* He causes the rain to pour and the sun to shine on the just and the unjust
* About the Christian philosophy of history - Van Til
* Antithesis - 
  * Ultimate contrast/opposition between the blessed destiny of God's people and the condemnation of people who rebel against God
  * Two kinds of people in God's eternal plan - elect and nonelect
  * If true, why today is everyone mixed together? Why don't Christians live in a protective shield?
  * Is the offer of the Gospel to a nonelect person sincere? Yes
  * Is prayer meaningful? Yes
  * The fact that anything good happens is an apparent contradiction to the antithesis
  * It is important for history to be real (Paul told the people not to lower the lifeboats, even though he knew everyone would be saved)
* Common grace teaches that God really is good and really does restrain evil on the just and the unjust alike
* Common grace is the playing field on which special grace is worked out 
  * Helps people stay alive
  * Gives them ears to hear the gospel
* Culture making is significant and will have eternal significance
  * Not just a way to pass the time
* Richard Mouw wrote *He Shines On All That's Fair*
  * Friendship between Franklin and Whitefield
    * God approves the friendship because friendship is good
    * No just because of evangelism

## Compare/contrast with unbelieving worldview

* Everyone lives with a tension of knowledge and ignorance
* Frame's frame

      Belief     Unbelief
