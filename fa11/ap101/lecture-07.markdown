* Need to balance between ideas and context
  * Chadwick - "The Secularization of the European Mind in the 19th Century"
    * Why did Marx's critique of religion become so popular?
      * Not primarily because people read him and understood him
      * His writings and slogans reached very willing ears
      * There was a perception that the church was keeping down by privilege ("religion was the opiate of the masses")
      * Sociology of knowledge = institutions are the only reason people believe things
      * Thought philosophy had a lot to say about why there could not be a god
      * Understood that you can't just rationalize religion away - had to do it more subtly
      * Ideas were based on vague parallels of Biblical eschatology (knew his OT very well)
        * Didn't believe in God, but believed promises of God were still lodged in the memory of the people
      * Religion was social phenomenon, caused by social phenomena and done away with by social phenomena
        * Outcome of a failing social structure which culiminated in bougeouise and capitalistic structures
    * What happened in the few years between the publication of Origin of the Species and the day when most schoolboys realized he refuted Genesis?
      * There were a lot of reasons why people wanted Darwin to be right
      * Now have a scientific basis for the things we've felt deeply for a while
  * World shapes the way we think not only because we believe the ideas but by the context in which we live
  * Made to live in a world of culture and context

# Globalization

* What is it?
  * An increasing connectivity and integration and interdependence in many different realms - economic, social, technological, cultural, political
  * A unitary process that includes a lot of subprocesses
    * Stock market in America tanking because Greece is about to go bankrupt and shake up the world of the Euro, which affects US trade and confidence
    * Since the end of the cold war, lots of borders have come down (Iron Curtain), movement of people was enhanced by politics and technology
      * Jet plane - can be in Hong Kong in 15 hours
      * Internet - buy soap, visit Turkey
      * Ideas - most national elites are educated in the same schools - Oxford, Harvard, etc. 
    * Gift of God gone wrong - meant to be properly interdependent. Babel wasn't just a curse, it was a slowing down of human potential gone wrong (reversed in Acts 2)
    * Rap culture began to influence how sports people dress (baggy shorts)

* Creates or expands the existing religious and ethnic diaspora communities around the world
  * Diaspora = mother culture is with you when you move away, by force or by choice
    * Reproduct original culture, interests, even conflicts
    * Need to learn how to assimilate and allow participation of unique ideas (Islam in Great Britain)
    * In Gaza Strip, values being shaped by Turkish soap opera more than official propaganda

* Apologetics needs strategies that take globalization seriously
  * Challenge and critique
  * Benefit from good parts

* 3 suggestions for apologetic strategies into a globalizing world
  * Lifestyle + ideas

1. Patience and pace
  * Challenge of globalization is acceleration of pace at which life moves
    * Emails have sense of urgency that letters didn't have
    * Havel (former president of Czech Republic, imprisoned for his anti-communist views)
      * Criticized for not changing things fast enough once elected president
      * Said to critics: "if you keep this demand up, you'll fall into the same danger of the communist oppressors. you'll be like a child who pulls up a flower because he wants it to grow faster"
    * Worst thing to do for old people in the last stage of life = wish for the old days
    * People have studied how things seem to go faster as you get older
      * When younger, everything is new, you process things a lot more slowly
      * Driving somewhere new seems a lot slower than driving home
      * As you get older, things don't shock you as much
      * So... slow down and savor things that matter
    * Unless you do slow down and ask the big questions, you will not be prepared for the future or right with God
      * Takes time, patience, skills, meditation to cultivate relationship with God

2. Combine working for justice with Gospel preaching
  * "Evangelism: Preaching Grace and Doing Justice" by Harvey Conn
    * Can't have one without the other
    * Can't only pay attention to people's needs and forget the words of the Gospel
    * 20th century saw an overreaction to liberalism's social gospel
    * If you're just talking to the soul, about getting into heaven, that's not salvation ???
  * Church's role
    * Don't forgetr the poor
    * Act for mercy (Paul collecting for Jerusalem)
    * Mercy ministry, diaconal work
    * Church doesn't have the sole responsibility, particularly in a democracy (government and otherwise)

3. Prosperity is not enough
  * In the West, so consumer driven that we ground our identity in things we have rather than who we are
  * In globalizing world, increasing division between the haves and the have-nots
    * Haves are computer savvy, live in cities and sit in board rooms and make decisions
    * Have-nots are immigrants, don't have access to the same kind of power, wish they had the same power as the haves had
  * Victor Franko did counseling in prison
    * Found people most likely to survive were those with some sort of religious hope
    * After he was freed, developed a method called "Logo Therapy"
      * Try to draw out from people the things that they hoped for that really mattered
      * Grandchild, patriotism, aesthetics
    * A way to build bridges with someone who is caught up in discontent

* Bring the gospel in a way that addresses both contextual issues and ideas


# Epistemology

* Knowledge in the Bible has a sense of relationship, thoughts, doctrines
  * God is the ultimate in every issue
  * Epistemology = study of and justification of knowledge
  * Van Til
    * God's knowledge is coterminous with his being
    * God is fully rational
      * To have the thought process that is based on his being and attributes
    * We can only know God by re-interpreting his self by our own abilities which are God-given
      * We can only know by thinking God's thoughts after him
    * God is totally coherent, totally consistent
      * We don't always see how he is consistent and coherent (Trinity, modalism)
      * Trinity = 1 person and 3 persons (instead of 1 essence and 3 persons)
      * Part of our limitation as human beings that we cannot connect these dots
        * Because we do not have exhaustive rationality (no defect in God)
  * We know through "analogy" (code for "thinking dependently" or "thinking God's thoughts after him")
    * Univocal thinking - unless I can think as God does (qualitatively, if not quantitatively), then I can't know at all
      * Hegel - "rational is the real and the real is the rational"
      * Christians - can't know truth unless you can claim to know as God knows
      * As creatures, our rational process is God-given but not the original, so we can't claim to have God's knowledge because we can't think like the creator things (we don't have full rationality)
    * Equivocal thinking - at no point do your knowledge coincide with God's knowledge/the truth. Because you're a creature, no access to what God is doing, can only know through a metaphor
      * God has told us we can understand him, that he isn't far from us (not up in the sky or down in the depths but in our hearts)
      * Moses objects to being sent by God, God replies, "Can I not put my words in your mouth"
    * Analogy - captures the truth of both, gives us real access to both - real knowledge in a creaturely mode
      * "Reasons for Faith" by Scott Oliphint
      * "Doctrine of the Knowledge of God" by John Frame
        * If I can know God by analogy, there are discontinuities and continuities
          * Discontinuities
            * God is uncreated, so his knowledge is uncreated. Man is created, so his knowledge is creaturely.
              * God never has to think something through. Doesn't need time. Doesn't need syllogisms.
              * Smartest human has to do some process. Likes puzzles, solving problems. God doesn't need to do any of this
            * God's knowledge is determinitive. Man's knowledge doesn't determine things.
              * God thinking something makes it true.
            * God's knowledge is self-validating. Man's knowledge if God-validated if its true.
              * God's standards for truth are his own. When he says something, its not true because it fits reality, but because it is God that says it.
            * God's knowledge is self-glorious. Man's knowledge must acknowledge the glory of God
              * God's knowledge isn't just abstractly true, but it honors him
            * God knows both more and differently from how we know.
          * Continuities
            * God's knowledge has the same standard as ours
              * Doesn't tell us things just on human terms as a mere concession to us
              * Secret things belong to God, but those that he's revealed are really true
            * God's knowledge and human knowledge are about the same objects
              * Talking about the same tree
            * God knows truly and we know truly
              * Not just abstract statement of fact ("This is the way it is")
              * No such thing as a "brute fact", only interpreted facts
              * Truth is not just an abstract statement of facticity, its a moral statement (doesn't mislead)
              * Not precision, but what you need to know to work on the problem
                * Would help discussions of inerrancy
              * True = not misleading
            * We, like God, know about everything
              * God knows everything exhaustively
              * If we have access to God and his revelation, in a certain manner we have access to everything
              * New things won't be a fundamental reversal or contradiction
            * God's knowledge is creative, ours is as well (in a certain way)
              * Analogy between Picasso painting and God creating the world
              * Creative arts are a reflection of the fact that God is a creator
  * What do we make of reason and logic?
    * Some say reason can get you to existence of God, but faith is needed to get beyond that
    * Need to qualify reason - magesterial and ministerial, autonomous and analogical
    * Reason = apparatus to judge the truth or falsehood of a state of affairs
    * Logic = rule book to tell you a particular procedure is wrong
    * Faith doesn't replace reason. It orients it.
      * Faith is knowledge, in the sense of knowing what the content is. Can't become a Christian unless you know some basics about sin, atonement, etc.
      * Faith is assent or belief. Need to agree that its true.
      * Faith is trust.
    * Faith has to be reasonable.
      * Ininformed, leap in the dark
    * Reason has to be faithful
      * Needs to trust
