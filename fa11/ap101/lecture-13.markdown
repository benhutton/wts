* Don't be listening to codewords to put people into boxes. Critical thinking cuts off creative thinking. Gotta engage with ideas.

## Four foundation points

* Integrity of one's character
  * What you do in your private life does matter
  * Look to see if a candidate's daily life mirrors their political life/positions
  * Character matters... what you do when no one is watching. We all live before an audience of one
  * Internet now allows people to spread any rumor with no accountability, and even if false and refuted, the damage has been done
  * We of all people should be understanding of the facts that 1.) we are all sinners and 2.) people do change
* Basis of one's authority/convictions
  * NOT a matter of scriptural prooftexting any position that you take
  * A willingness to be open and accountable and explain the process by which you got to a position
  * At times not appropriate to bring scripture in 
    * Person won't feel helped or able to trust your decision making
* Creativity of one's thinking
  * Danger of confusing ideology with theology
    * Don't take a position then look for scriptural basis
  * Both parties suffer from a failure to understand the nature of man
    * Leads to positions that are naive and unable to deal with the reality of evil and sin
    * Democrats naively trust in government and the state and fail to recognize that the government is nothing more than people and structures will not produce change when it is people that have to produce change
    * Republicans naively think that the least government is the best government and we just need to let individuals do their thing... individuals are sinners and government can restrain man
    * Possible because of humanity's potential for justice, necessary because of humanity's inclination to injustice
    * Cult of individualism... I am the ultimate authority and no one has the right to tell me what to do
    * "Least government is the best government" = selfishness
  * Only the believer understands and should not be shocked by how people act
    * Man is evil but noble because he's made in God's image
  * God is a God of order, not chaos, and has commanded us to have dominion
    * Mandate to explore the world
  * Can't just go along with "cobelligerents"... need to think through issues yourself
  * Surround yourself with people with different ideas... fight groupthink (enemy of creative thinking and biblical thinking)
* Quality of one's relationships
  * With friends 
    * Naively think that because you're a Christian you'll be immune from pressures
    * Jimmy Carter was a lone ranger, got out of touch with everyone
    * William Wilberforce had group of like-minded people
    * Develop a network of friends to whom you make yourself vulnerable and invite to hold you accountable
  * With opponents
    * If you don't want to debate the issue, you attack the person
    * Media battle of character assassination, not a discussion of real issues
    * If we don't show winsomeness and persuasiveness in debates with opponents, we don't belong in politics

## Caring for the elderly

* Going to be a major issue
  * Defining issue for really churches to really stand out like lights in their community
  * Finally realizing we don't have limitless resources and need to make decisions about allocations of resources
  * Dealing with chronic deficit issues and deficit impact on economy and the future
  * Politicians are now being eaten alive by the electorate they stirred up to support them
* 78 million baby boomers are turning 65
  * Entitled generation
  * AARP has made this a third rail in politics
* We have embraced an unbiblical view of work... goal of life is early retirement and play
  * Will bankrupt country fiscally and of a vitally needed workforce
* "Retire" means "go away"
  * Disengage from work
  * Disappear
  * Die
* What do we do with people 63-85?
  * Can't afford to have these people retire and taking government benefits
  * Need these people engaged
  * Key to "live long, die short" is cognitive stimulation and social engagement
  * People who disconnect do begin to disappear
  * We have an unbiblical prejudice against age
