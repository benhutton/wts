## The Problem of Evil

* Most common question
* What are the sources of evil?
  * Natural sources - disasters, earthquakes, famines, disease
  * People - cruelty towards one another
    * Suddenly - assassination of JFK
    * Slowly - Maoism, Naziism
    * Suddenly - evil corporations
* What is evil?
  * What should not be
  * Apex (according to novelists) is the death of a child
  * Equal-opportunity - no one escapes it
* Not only a Christian problem
* Bible gives very sobering, realistic accounts
* 3 questions
  * What is evil?
  * What is its origin?
  * What can we do about it?

## Explanations

1. Pedagogical Explanation
  * God uses evil to bring about good
  * People learn from it
  * "You meant it for evil but God meant it for good" - Genesis 50:20
  * Romans 5 - we rejoice IN (the midst of) our suffering
  * Leads to hope
  * Cross of Jesus takes evil and uses it for good
  * Weaknesses:
    * Will not do as an explanation for the origin of evil

2. Evil is an illusion
  * Philosophic Hinduism
    * No real creation, but only a passage from the center to the universe
    * The farther from the center, the more illusory it is
  * Buddhism
    * Detachment is the only way to deal with suffering
    * Very wide spread in the West in different forms
  * Gnosticism, Christian Science
    * Material world is of lesser importance, reality, than the spiritual world
  * Bible
    * Evil is a hopeless way to construct a world that does not conform with reality
    * One day it will pass and it will be like a terrible nightmare
    * In this sense, evil is an impossible construct
    * Of course, evil is still real and Jesus still died a bloody death

3. The imperfect of the good
  * The necessary imperfection in a world that's perfect
  * 18th Century Optimism
    * Theodicy - justifying God - can God be just in a world where there is evil
    * Leibnitz - argued that God created the best of all possible worlds
      * Evil is needed to showcase the good
    * Chain of being
    * Tapastry - on the back its a mess, but flip it over and its beautiful
  * Weaknesses:
    * Evil is not just a link in a chain, an unfortunate accident
    * Stark reality that affects every one of us
    * Everyone is a victim and a perpetrator

4. Dualism
  * Good and evil are (nearly) equal forces in the universe
  * Manecheism
    * Augustine began here
    * Resembles gnosticism in certain ways
    * Humans caught between the Father of lights and the Prince of darkness
    * Through discipline and diet you can put yourself in line with the Father of lights and climb up to eternal life
    * Often evil is in things
    * Gave people a sense that they had a power, almost elite wisdom, to identify good and evil and put themselves on the trajectory toward the good
  * Some theologies make Satan much more powerful than he is... say that Jesus barely resisted the temptations
  * People thought rock and roll was inherently evil
    * But there's no such thing as a good or bad note. Its like a language
    * Evil is in the abuse, not the material
  * Weaknesses
    * Satan is alive but not well
    * One little word shall fell him

5. The risk of freedom
  * Free will argument
  * Popular in evangelical circles
  * Evil does not come from God, but from humanity
    * God created us free
    * To guarantee freedom, making a wrong choice must be a possibility
    * All he did was create people with choice
    * People abuse this, but you can't blame God for that
  * Refinement = kenosis theory
    * God "emptied" himself, gave us some of his power
    * God doesn't mess with us
  * No necessity of evil in the universal order
  * Prizes freedom
  * Win-win - God creates but he doesn't make evil
  * Weaknesses
    * If God is all-powerful, how does he give up power and still be called God? In Jesus he ADDED humanity
    * If God makes the world with the possibility of evil, does that really get him off the hook? Is it really "good" and "very good"?

6. The right view?
  * Evil is an outrage to God
    * Opposed vigorously and resolution
    * No bargain between God and evil
    * However mysterious some things are, this is clear
  * Creation is good, evil is a cancer on it
    * We don't fight creation, we fight the cancer
    * After Lazarus died, Jesus was furious at death
  * Who is accountable? Human beings
  * God is utterly sovereign, the cause of whatever comes to pass
  * WCF, 3.1 - God ordained whatsoever comes to pass, yet he is not the author of sin, won't violate our freedom/will or secondary causes
  * Scripture tells us everything about the solution to the problem of evil
    * Need to realize that we are responsible
    * Fall was ethical, not metaphysical - Van Til
    * God will bring justice to the entire planet
    * We help to bring healing and amelioration into a broken world
  * Freedom
    * Today we only interpret it in one way: "the ability to make an alternative choice"
    * Bible: human agency is real/significant/meaningful. Our action is worthy of blame or approbation. Human choice belongs to us, not constrained by external force
    * Dispositional complex - tendencies, desires, motives
    * Before the Fall: posse piccarre - man could sin
    * Fallen, before redemption: nonposse nonpiccarre - not possible not to sin
    * Redeemed: posse nonpiccarre - possible not to sin
    * In heaven: nonposse piccarre - not possible to sin
      * Will is released from bondage to sin nature
  * The invisible world
    * First, recognize reality, oppressive power
      * "Greatest ruse of the devil is to make people think he doesn't exist"
      * Halloween trivializes Satan and makes Satan happy
    * Second, others exaggerate the role of the supernatural
      * Resist the devil and he will flee from you
    * Satan may be powerful, but he can't make you sin
    * More in the Bible about the moral life of obedience than the spiritual world
