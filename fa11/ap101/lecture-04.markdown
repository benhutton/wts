# Worldview Thinking

## Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920)

* Reformed theologian, politician, prime minister of Holland
* Did a great deal to shape contemporary evangelical thought
* Was a minister in the Reformed Church
* Two things changed his life
  * Fiance got him to read a book whose main character was deeply pious
  * As a minister, he would call on parishioners.  One of them said to him, "I'm not really sure you're a Christian."  
* Established a Christian newspaper - a weekly that contained articles about all areas of life from a Christian perspective
* Founded Free University of Amsterdam, a Christian university where you could get the Christian take on all the disciplines
* *Lectures on Calvinism* give best take on worldview thinking
  * Sketches the contours of a Christian worldview that applies to every area of life
  * Kept Reformed thinking alive and kept it away from anti-intellectualism of some revival churches
  * Calls it "life conception"
* "Sphere Sovereignty"
  * Intitutions and entities that coexist in our diverse world but should not claim power over the other
  * Separation of church and state
  * 2 kinds of secularization.  Good = removal of spheres of life from the church into their own.
  * Everything under the lordship of Christ, but in different ways
  * The church has the authority of the Word and the keys to the Kingdom
  * The state has the authority to rule and bring justice and provide some mercy and some culture
  * Reciprocity between the spheres
  * Overreaches a little ("it was good for Calvin to banish art from the church")
* Neo-calvinism
* Worldview is based on faith commitment to something (God, atheism, pantheism)

## Worldview began to interact with anthropology

* Robert Redfield
* Clifford Geertz - symbols in worldview.  If you analyze culture, you can figure out what people are thinking and where their hearts are.
  * Himalayas.  British => mountains are something to be conquered or overcome, death makes you a hero.  Sherpas => death is a tragedy, devil won.
* Trend is to enrich conceptual idea of worldview with other disciplines
  * Os Guinness - doctorate in sociology, did implications of Peter Berger on Christian Apologetics
