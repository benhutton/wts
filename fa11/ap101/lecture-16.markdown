# Christianity and Science

## Dawkins/Lennox Debate

* Dawkins' misperceptions
  * When you say "faith" you don't mean "reason"
    * War in his mind between people of faith and people of reason
  * If there was a God, he would have had to been designed/created

## Conflict between Faith and Science

* History shaped by conflict and harmony
  * As Christians, we don't see a conflict at all
  * Massive struggle in the West to move away from Aristotle at the risk of greater secularization (when doing science without that model)
* Aristotle
  * The West shares a great dependence on the Greeks for doing science
  * Medicine developed by the Greeks, filtered into Islam and the West by their philosophers
  * Aristotle was most important philosopher (384-322 BC)
  * Shifted emphasis that Plato brought from heavenly realities to more earthly things
  * Believed that God is the first cause, prime mover, doesn't actively govern the world because he moves the world through laws
  * The world and its forms matter
  * Classified all kinds of areas of life
    * Below the moon, in the ether, there are earth, water, air, and fire, which are always in motion within the forms
    * The closer they are to the highest form, the closer they are to divinity
    * Physics was study of form of each thing to see how close it is to divinity
    * Classified plants
  * Developed philosophy of science
    * Categories in which to think
    * Between Plato and Atomists (world is senseless matter)
  * Form + matter work together to shape the way things are 
    * Made possible by first cause = God
  * Earth is at the center of everything (because God determined it)
    * Planets, moon, stars all move around the earth - geocentric system
    * Medievals took Aristotle over but Christianized it
      * Decided that this is the way God wanted the universe
      * Study of nature becomes our science (they called it philosophy)
      * Study of astronomical phenomena proved that God put the earth at the center of the universe
      * We are part of a giant machine
        * Sin is a malfunction
        * Intellect is relatively unfallen
    * Aquinas = Aristotle + Church Fathers + The Bible
      * Method is to prove God is good/knowable by a giant synthesis
      * Occasionally faults Aristotle, but this is rare
      * Philosophy becomes the "handmaid" of theology
  * As Greece and Rome were eclipsed, Muslims carried on science
    * Version of Aristotle that Aquinas would have read would have come from Arabic philosophers
  * Plow, windmill, compass, ship design, agricultural productivity, navigation contributed to development of cities, attributed to Aristotle
    * Can slip in angels to help explain any difficulties
  * This is all what the church believed
    * When the paradigm began to shift because it wasn't sufficient, it was traumatic for the church
* Galileo (1600s)
  * God the creator ordered the universe by mathematical principles
  * Accepted the findings of Copernicus who argued that the Sun was the center of the solar system
  * Ran into serious trouble because he dared to question the Aristotelian system
  * Cardinal Bellarmine was the leader of the counter-reformation
    * Wrote that the Copernican system could not be defended without a physical demonstration that the earth circled the sun
    * Would not accept Galileo: that you can prove sun centered universe by observation and mathematics
  * Had to take on popular interpretations of Bible verses: 
    * "God has made the world; it cannot be moved"
    * Sun rises + sets
    * Follows Augustine to say that this is phenomenalogical language (based on how we see it), not a statement of cosmology
  * Defends his views in Rome to Pope Urban VIII
    * Was his friend
    * Got a pass
  * Bellarmine got the Inquisition to ban his book, ban him from holding his views
    * Galileo was put on trial and found guilty
    * Pope was drifting away as a friend (Pope needed a way to make the church like him again)
  * Conflict was based on the assumption that Aristotle, until proven wrong, was absolutely correct
  * Placed under house arrest
  * Protestants were increasingly buying into the Copernican/Galilean model
  * Church was losing the confidence of the people
  * Church was accused of holding back progress
    * Need to be careful that progress be Biblical
    * And need to recognize that progress is not always uniform
  * In discussion about this, need to clarify that the Catholic church here was not = the whole church
  * Also need to realize that the battle was over giving up an Aristotelian model (not simply faith vs. science)
  * Modern western science owes a good deal to people who took the scriptures seriously and wanted to reverse the effects of the fall
    * Some people believed they could get back to the world that Adam lived in
    * Reimagine the world that Adam would have first seen
* Francis Bacon
  * Statesman, lawyer, ambassador, very important contributor to modern science
  * Goals
    * Discover truth
    * Serve country
    * Serve the church
  * Not primarily a scientist, but a thinker
  * Never wanted the Bible to be a science text, but believed that Aristotle needed to be replaced by something more biblical
  * Said that God revealed himself in two books - Bible + nature - and they needed to work in tandem, not conflict
  * "You err, because you know neither the scriptures nor the poewr of God"
  * Deeply wary of rationalism b/c it sought to imnpose a human standard on the greater standard of nature
  * Invented the scientific method
    * Collect facts, form theory, test the theory, see if it predicts the outcome over and over again
  * Want to mess with nature to figure out how it works
  * Had a sense of the Cultural Mandate
  * Argued that artificial compounds should be made and that they could have the same value as natural ones
    * Medievals would have said gold and silver are the most valuable
  * Novum Organum = most famous book
    * The New Instrument
    * Critique of Aristotle
    * Argues for a new system of logic
      * Inductive investigation, testing hypothesis
    * Looks for situations where heat is found, then looks for what is in common between all these circumstances
      * List of things that have heat, don't have heat, vary in heat
* Newton (1643-1727)
  * Considered by some historians to be the greatest mind on planet Earth
  * Devoutly religious, though some doctrines would need to be questioned
  * Austere and serious, seemed lovely and joyless to acquantainces
  * Masterpiece was in theoretical physics - Principia Matematica
    * Synthesis
    * Established mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, acoustics
    * Written in Latin
    * Proofs were geometrical (even though he invented calculus)
  * Published "Optics", written in English with more experimental queries
  * Had always been fascinated with theology
    * Anglican
    * Problems with trinity
    * Not a deist - God was immanent
    * God created the universe, keeps it under surveilance, and intervenes
    * Jesus = messiah, son of God (though more of a viceroy for the Father than a propitiation)
    * Goal to seek creator through his actions
* Darwin
  * On The Origin of the Species (1859)
    * Traveled on the Beagle for 6 years, visited Galapagos Islands
    * Came to believe that the species were not stable
    * Missionaries seemed advanced and stable than the natives on the islands. Where they more evolved?
    * Read Maltas, who said that there was not enough food in the world and there would be a struggle to survive
    * Process of evolution would be by survival of the fittest
    * Appeared as though miraculous causes for origins would be unnecessary
    * Darwin clearly felt that traditional view of creation, by God's direction action, was unnecessary
    * Knew there was a God, but felt increasingly that he was far away and uninvolved
    * As many more individuals of each species are born that could possibly survive, it follows that any being, if it varied profitably, would have a better chance of surviving. From inheritance, modified form would be propagated
      * Avoided mentioning humanity
      * But clearly it should be extrapolated
  * On The Descent of Man
  * Not able to demonstrate that major changes could come through natural selection
    * Suspected it, but could never prove it
* Neo-darwinism
  * Genetic mutations occur that make large changes
  * In recombination, large strands of DNA are swapped
  * Recombination + mutation are purely by chance
  * Largest demonstration is human genome
    * Studying genome can give picture as to how humans evolved
  * Changes happen by chance and thus are purposeless
  * Objective investigator should be open to design (Francis Collins believed in design)
  * People think that genetics has finally banished God into the last gap possible
  * Scopes trial
    * Dayton, TN
    * Scopes was teaching Darwinism to his science classes, which was against the law
    * ACLU decided to come to his defense
    * Defender was Clarence Darrow (the Johnny Cochran of the day)
    * Prosecutor was William Jenning Bryan
    * Trial took several weeks
    * Prosecution won, Scopes was fined $100
    * BUT, the popular image, in the media...
      * End of credible fundamentalism
      * Question of whether a religion that believed the Bible could have any discussion with science
    * Bryan has no problem with long creation, microevolution
      * Problem was the elites in NY dictating what they were studying
      * Populist
      * People in God's image vs. Survival of the fittest
    * Darrow was an atheist, ridiculed fundamentalists, lost the trial, won the public opinion
      * Made Christians seem obscurantist and ridiculous
  * Darwinian evolution believes that the march of diversity and the appearance of man is purposeless, so a good scientist cannot believe in God
  * Kenneth Ham: If the Bible is true, Darwinism is impossible
  * Three basic issues
    * Is macroevolution a proven theory?
      * Fossil record does not confirm a slow and steady development toward modern diversity
        * Too many missing links
        * Nothing found to link invertebrates to vertebrates
      * The "trade secret of paleantology"
        * Developed punctuated equilibrium - rapid changes had to have happened
    * How do the Bible and science relate?
      * Non-overlapping magesteria => Bible discusses Spiritual + moral truths, but not scientific data
        * Problem is that Bible touches on history and the cosmos rather often
        * Not meant to be a scientific textbook, but there is a root and ground in history
      * Hodge believed there could be a certain amount of guided evolution compatible with the Bible
      * Day-Age theory - creation week could have taken millions of years
      * Unique genre - perhaps Genesis 1 and 2 is its own genre
      * Is Gen 1+2 a scientific text?
        * Not by modern scientific standards
      * Room for discussion of what the text says and how it says it
      * Days could be analogical days, not chronological days - work then rest
        * Days are events, occasions, when God accomplished various tasks
        * Contents of days are topical
    * What teachings of the Bible do we need to respect?
      * God created the heavens and the earth, regardless of means
      * Humans were specially created (Gen 1:26, 2:27), NOT the product of a long evolutionary process
      * Adam specially created, made as an adult
        * Adam and Eve served as unity of the human race
        * Analogous to Christ as head
      * Doctrinaire neo-darwinism is unacceptable
        * Nowhere is this kind of competition a virtue
        * Self-assertion like this is loveless; fostered by most totalitarian regimes
        * Hard not to connect to racism
  * We shouldn't let this debate obscure everything else
