# Method of Argument

* Van Til: To argue by presupposition is to indicate what are the epistemological and metaphysical principles that underline your philosophy.
* Method is related by principles
* Want to be both aware of and methodologically guided by presuppositions
* Assumptions, pre-understanding, bias, paradigm
* Presupposition: what are the transcendental beginning points/assumptions by which we guide our thinking and argument?
  * Van Til would have preferred the term "trancendental"
  * Beginning with God as precondition of meaning and value
  * Recognize that everyones worldview rests on a religious commitment, either towards God or towards idols
  * There is no neutrality - neither thought or behavior are independent of religious presupposition
  * Some things are more useful than others, though
  * Most people are unaware of the connection between how they live and transcendental conditions
    * Skepticism is a kind of religion
  * Christian worldview based on a priori assumption that the world makes sense because God is God
    * World does not have meaning; the world *is* meaning - Dooyewerd
  * Nonchristian worldview tries to make sense of the world without this
  * Goal of presuppositionalism is to show that a worldview cannot hold together
  * Need to show how presuppositions underly everyones thinking and claims
* Presuppositions are strongly related to **paradigm**
  * Connect 9 dots in square (need to "think outside the box")
  * Pope vs. janitor debating with signs
  * Man lost in NYC thinking he was in Italy
  * Term **paradign shift** - Thomas Kuhn in *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*
    * Scientific progress is not achieved by better observation, but by paradigm shifts
    * Copernicus didn't move our understanding of the solar system based on better observation
    * Thought "this is complicated. Would God use such a complicated system?"
  * What is a paradigm?
    * Mental rules for solving problems
    * Rules are fine until enough data come in that you can't work with it (too many exceptions)
    * Change the rules, put the sun at the center, and everything works out
  * Paradigm shift is very similar to what we're talking about with presuppositions
    * We're asking people to shift their paradigm when they come to Christ
    * Kuhn first got his idea from Paul's conversion in Acts 9
    * Coming to the Gospel is *more* than a paradigm shift, because it involves shifting morals and values and trust and commitment.
    * Christ needs to go from stumbling stone to cornerstone
* How did Van Til use the term *presupposition*?
  * Almost any point of Christian doctrine can be called the Christian presupposition
  * "Christian Theism"
  * The Christian God or ontological trinity
  * God speaking in scripture
  * Christ is self-authenticating and needs no more basic foundation
  * Presuppositions are a matter of criteria
* When one grasps presuppositions, you realize they form a system
  * Van Til: "The truth of the story" - there is an account of reality which is true - what's really going on
  * Beginning, middle, end, plot, philosophy of history, characters
  * Hope is a story - not finished, but written
  * All facts make sense because of God's plan. If we do presuppose Christ through the Bible, it is in that light we see all things. All facts are preinterpreted, they tell the true story b/c GOd has written it and revealed it to us
  * Only 2 presuppositions possible - Christian and nonchristian
    * Gospel teaches way of life and way of death
    * Nonchristian - man is ultimate reference point in human predication
    * Christian - God is ultimate reference point in human predication
  * Aren't Christians likely to be inconsistent? Yes, but even that is predicted/consistent with Romans 7
  * Method depends on seeing inconsistencies embedded in unbelieving philosophy
    * His system doesn't predict his inconsistencies (our system does)
  * In another sense, only 1 presupposition - only 1 truth, which is true whether we believe it or not
    * Schaffer - its truth doesn't depend on whether I buy into it or not
  * Men should believe in God, it is abnormal to not believe in God
* Charge against presuppositionalism is fideism - belief for the sake of belief, "leap in the dark"
  * John Warwick Montgomery - brilliant pure evidentialist
  * Shouting match, talking past each other - "Our Bible says we get to take over planet earth!"
  * But... there's a **point of contact**... unbeliever knows God and tries to suppress that knowledge of God (Romans 1:18)
  * Appeal to what nonchristians know (yet suppress), not to some abstract arbitrary fact
  * Point of contact is the sense of deity within every person
  * "What about the native?" - everyone has enough to be accountable
* In one sense our reasoning is circular
  * If God is God, and there's no test behind him...
  * But of course this is circular - how would you leap out of the system to prove an ultimate?
  * But everything is ultimately circular, if you believe in an ultimate
  * But its not a vicious circle... vast difference between reasoning in a circle and arguing in a circle
    * We don't argue from a barebones appeal to authority, but from reasons
    * Mistake to say that presuppositionalism is against evidences - God created world full of evidence
    * Difference from evidentialism is that presuppositionalists are always attentive to paradigms and heart commitments
  * Point of contact comes out of debate with Barth, who said there is no point of contact within the natural man
    * Natural man has no revelation
    * Gospel comes with its own point of contact
