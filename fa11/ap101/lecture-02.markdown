# Lecture 2 - Scripture commends apologetics

## 1 Peter 3:15

* Written by Peter to the church in general, a primary Gentile church
* Letter of encouragement, which people needed because of adversity
* Believers as exiles - this is not our final home
* All Christians will suffer, and preaching seems to invite suffering
  * Some suffering comes because we deserve it
  * All suffering is the result of a fallen world
  * Not all suffering comes from my choices
  * Suffering won't lead to final, ultimate harm
  * In the synoptics: "Fear not what you will say (apologeomai) when they drag you before the Sanhedrin"

* Adapting Isaiah 8:12-13 and parallelling in 1 Peter 3:14-15

### Isaiah 8
    12 Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. 
    13 But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.

* Don't worry about conspiracy, not because there aren't conspiracies, but because no conspiracy will ultimately triumph
* Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy
* What we need is to lift up Christ in our hearts
  * Heart is the center of everything.  Where everything happens
  * Proverbs: "Guard your hearts"
  * Trusting Christ is the right setting for apologetics

* Greek: apologia = apo + logia
  * logia - word
  * apo - for, unto

* Apologetics isn't just defensive, but has a commendation factor
  * Not just handling objections or taking on critics
  * Need to commend the Gospel
  * "Vindicate the Christian world and life view" - Van Til


* "Be prepared" = Boy Scout Motto, from this text
  * Understanding the times (Issachar)
  * Understanding the human heart - knowing what the deeper issues are

* Not here to win arguments, but win people

* "To give a reason for the *hope* that you have"
  * not "a body of systematic theology"
  * not "the Gospel"
  * hope = certainty of what is and what is to come
    * has tension in it
    * already/not yet
    * Gospel is not a wish but a certainty

* "Gentleness and respect, with a clear conscience"
  * Need to learn to be vigorous and gentle
  * Not doing things out of heat

* How is "Fear not what you say, the HS will give you the words" not in contrast to this?
  * HS works to use the words

## All of scripture

* Jesus' ministry engaged in apologetics all the time
  * Luke 2:34 - And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, â€œBehold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed
  * Jesus with Sanhedrin
  * Jesus' trial
  * Jesus' death -> centurion saying "surely this man was the son of God"

* Paul
  * "We try to persuade men"
  * Gospel came to Thessalonians "with the HS and with great conviction" - both are part
  * Acts ends in Rome... Gospel reached the greatest power in the world and began undoing it. Calendar eventually changed to center on Jesus' birth
