# Intelligent Design

## Dempsky

* Divine Inference???

## Michael Behe

* Argues for irreducible complexity
* Things are so complex that you can't explain the evolution of it by process
  * Mouse trap doesn't make sense by evolution... the parts don't make sense alone
  * William Paley first formulated this argument in the 19th century, using a clock

* ID called an "argument from ignorance"

## Jonathan Wells

* Icons of evolution
* Bio textbooks promote fraudulent or inaccurate science
* Lawyer wrote a textbook author: "There's no evidence for this picture". Reponse: "Yeah, but its helpful for young people"

* Clear from the things we observe that there's an invisible person with deity, attributes, power
* Informally, people look at the world and presuppose that at least something as beautiful and wonderful planned it out

* Limits
  * God is not a designer, he's a creator creating by eternal decree
    * He does a lot more than design complexity
    * No one can know anything unless there's a God (self-consciousness is possible because of God-consciousness)
  * Doesn't deal with evil - doesn't account for what is obviously not a result of a good designer

# Natural Law

* God has implanted the knowledge of an order (moral, design) in every person (Romans 1 - this goes against nature)
* Aquinas: eternal law by which God established the cosmos is imprinted onto us and nature
  * Can deduce this by listening to reason
  * Only one natural law, so that people from every part of the world have it
  * Unchangeable, can't be removed, different degrees of consciousness of it
* Calvin would go with creator/creature distinction over against natural law
* Most reformed theologians stay away from natural law because they fear natural theology
  * (Meaning special revelation is less necessary)
  * Karl Barth was greatest opponent of natural theology and natural law
    * Barth rejected the point of contact because of this
* Probably best to just refer to general and special revelation
