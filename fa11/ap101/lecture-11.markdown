# The Trancendental Method

* Part 1: Disclosure
  * It is impossible to be consistent without being a Christian, so there will be some point of friction eventually
* Part 2: Homecoming
  * Inviting unbelievers to see things in the Christian way
    * Inviting the unbeliever to the Christian ground for arguments sake, to show how wonderfully Christianity fits reality. - Van Til
    * "Taste and see that the Lord is good."
    * Show adequacy, sufficiency, satisfaction that comes from embracing Christianity
    * The Prodigal God - generous
  * At the center = Jesus Christ's person and work
    * Came to reveal the Father and sacrifice himself for sinners
    * Liar, Lunatic, Lord question
      * Should never think of Jesus as good moral teacher - he would have been a liar if his claims were not true
      * "Give everything up and follow me" is not good moral teaching unless it is true
      * Few people think Jesus came and intentionally deceived his followers
      * More people think there's a difference between the true Jesus and what we have in the Bible today
        * "The search for the historical Jesus"
        * The Da Vinci Code
        * Early on, the church found ways to hide the true Jesus from the people and put in his place a doctrinal structure
        * Response: Show that there's a convergence between Jesus, Paul, and the early church
      * Did not act like a lunatic - lunatics don't have consistent teaching or a clear goal
    * What about self-deceived crowd-reinforced prophet-turned-messiah?
      * Conscious of who he was from the beginning
      * Had lots of opposition too
    * Peter Berger - "A Rumor of Angels"
      * Signals of transcendence
      * Indices that speak of a moral, orderly universe
      * Show people that tend to doubt the orderliness of the universe
      * Order: When a child grows up, he needs to be socialized. Child crying about storm, comforted by mother saying, "Its going to be okay. Everything will be fine." How does the mother know that?
        * Schaeffer: Airplanes are beautiful, because they need to conform to what's there if they have any chance of flying.
      * Moral: When someone acts in a condemnatory way, even if no reason for it, is reflecting a moral universe. "Holocaust is evil."
      * Humor: "I don't have to outrun the lion. I just have to outrun you." Sense of justice and cleverness. Comedians make us reflect on what is wrong with life.
      * Games: Chess, Soccer. Things are apparently artificial.
      * Beyond the horizon, there's a world where things are different, right, just
    * Impact of Christianity on culture
      * Small group in an obscure part of the world turned the world upside down
      * Took women very seriously as true human beings
      * Valued the life of babies
      * Response to Galen Plague
        * Had a robust view of evil - plagues were not a complete surprise. Had a meaning structure.
        * Had a true sense of community
        * Had real compassion
      * Hospitals, human rights, democracies, care for the vulnerable
      * Abolished slave trade and slavery
  * Reasons for doubt
    * Bottom line: they're sinners
    * Many have emotional reactions to Christianity, not logical difficulties
    * Descartes: looking for the "rock of indubitability" - looking for one great proof to build everything on
      * Many people throw their faith away b/c they thought they had this rock, tried to build on it, and failed. "God wasn't there when I needed him to be."
    * The cost of discipleship
      * "Do I have to give up/be willing to give up _____________ to be a Christian?"
      * Rich young ruler
    * God as a crutch
      * "If I can believe it, it can't be true"
  * In some apologists, there is a lack of imagination
    * Evangelicals are tremendously predictable people
    * How do we surprise them in a good, subversive way?
    * Jesus did this with parables
    * Nathan did this with David
    * Stories that drew you in until you realize it is about you
    * Subversion
