# Background of apologetics in the Old Testament

* From the beginning God engaged humanity in the calling to "fill the earth and subdue it"
  * Does this with an apologetic call
  * Made after the image of God means we have a function in this world
    * Prophetic - explore world, examine it, name it (attributing meaning). Names often symbolize a person's life and calling (Isaac = laughter)
    * Priestly - gathering, growing, subduing, building - bringing what we do before God as worship
    * Kingly - subdue the earth, gentle lordship
  * Satan's argument in the garden was a faulty apologetic based on a half truth
  * Much of OT prophecy is a corrective apologetic to Satan's faulty apologetic
  * Prophets invite the people: "Come now, let us reason together"
* Every part of the Bible has an apologetic payoff
  * Genesis 1-11 is a historical genre with literary intentions
    * Genesis 1:1 is a polemical statement
    * Image of God
    * Genesis 3 gives the reason for evil - not finitude or crisis in our past, but because our first parents deliberately turned against God and committed "cosmic treason"
    * *Not The Way It's Supposed To Be* by Neil Plantinga
  * Kings proves to Israel that its bad to have any king other than the Lord (judgment)
  * Chronicles proves to Israel that God is still in control (hope)
  * Job proves that faith can be real in horrible suffering, not just blessing, and redemption can only come through the suffering of a truly righteous man
  * Esther proves that even when it seems that God is absent, he preserves his people and accomplishes his plans
  * Matthew proves to Jews that Jesus is the fulfillment of the law and promises
  * Mark is a powerful urgent appeal focusing everyone on Christ and the Cross (read *King's Cross* by Keller)
  * Luke gives an accurate historical account to Theophilus of everything that had happened
  * John written "that you might believe"
  * Romans is about God's justice (a "justification of God")
* All of scripture is an argument - a plea - for the justice of God and the mercy of God

# Apologetics Definitions

* "There are two purposes of Christian apologetics. The first is defense. The second is to communicate Christianity in a way that any given generation can understand." - Schaffer
* "Apologetics is the vindication of the Christian philosophy of life against the various forms of the non-Christian philosophy of life." - Van Til

# Christian Worldview

* Foundations and preconditions whereby your life has meaning and value and sense
* Know the "whys" so that you can speak to them
* Develop a Christian worldview in response
* What is a worldview? How far can we go with it? Why the optic language of "view"?
  * Danger = overextension, imperialism
  * Piecing things together instead of seeing them piece-meal
* History of worldview thinking
  * Romans blamed Christian monotheism for defeat of Rome.  Augustine wrote *City of God* as a response to this showing that Christians care more about Rome than anyone else.
    * First Christian philosophy of history
    * In the ancient world, history was circular, not linear and progressing somewhere
  * Immanuel Kant - 1724-1804

    * Concerned to see the preconditions in peoples philosophy which gave them meaning
    * Seeing the substrate beyond mere appearances

  * William Green
    * Major contributor to the history of ideas
    * One of the first conservative commentators on the French Revolution
      * Why kings? Is there really a divine right?
      * Why the church? Is there really only one religion?
    * Wrote *Revolution and Unbelief* 
      * Underlying everything was a religious motif without God or law
      * Reason was elevated, replacing God
      * Historical event was based on a worldview
      * Underneath various major movements, there is often a theological or philosophical worldview that surfaces
