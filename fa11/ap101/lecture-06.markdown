# Humility in worldview thinking

* The heart is the center of being
* Worldview, like the human heart, is messy
* Hard to pidgeonhole
* Need to mainly recognize that we are disunited, deep, and complex, and that no 2 people are exactly alike
* It's easy to overreach and claim too much into worldview
  * Many claim that the Christian worldview has changed every part of culture
  * Hootsie and Tutu violence in spite of their professed Christianity
  * Presbyterian churches confess to be elder-ruled yet still are functionally senior-pastor-led

# Tools

## Biblical term "World"

* Positive connotation - everything God made
* Negative connotation - worldliness, a conspiracy of a society against God
* Both are true, and both characterize every civilization

## Looking at our culture, need to categorize things into good and bad

* Modernity
  * A spirit of critical inquiry - scientific method, observe the world via investigation.  We can investigate the world because it's the place God made.
    * Good - advances in things like medicine and life expectancy
    * Bad - show how right you are, that you're the judge, and that revelation is unnecessary. Bible became subject of critical inquiry rather than a holy book where you meet God.
* Post-modernity
  * Not very different from modernity
  * World is bits and pieces that don't hold together in a rational scheme
  * Incredulity to metanarratives

## Secularization

* Earliest form was the separation of institutions, such as government, from the church (a good thing)
* "Secular priest" in the middle ages worked outside the monastery
* In 1960s, sociologists predicted that the day would come when we wouldn't need the "crutch of religion" anymore
  * 1976 - Newsweek "Year of the Evangelical"
  * 1979 - Iranian revolution
  * 1980s - Countries like Brazil became very relgious
  * 1989 - Demise of communism (atheist worldview)
* Peter Berger - predicted secularization because of pluralization, observed that he got it wrong, researched, and wrote that secularization is wrong
* What's happening is de-secularization. The world is exploding with religion
  * Even Europe has amazing pockets of revival
  * Subsaharan Africans planting churches in France
* Theism is a bigger challenge today than atheism
