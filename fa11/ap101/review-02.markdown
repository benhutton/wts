# The Paper

* Choose a topic
* Make sure you understand well, but don't need to do outside research
  * Demonstrate a proper, sympathetic understanding of the person's view
  * If you were to give your account to the person, would he agree with you?
  * Avoid caricature and strawman
* Presuppositional response
  * If the world is created by God, then there is only one was to make sense of life, which is from the Biblical perspective
  * Anyone who does not come from a biblical point of view will have distortion and contradictions
  * We should be able to spot contradictions and inconsistencies
  * Person is not able to give a cohesive account
  * Show how the biblical account provides an adequate perspective to the issue (homecoming)
    * Present the Gospel
    * Try not to be preachy - this is hard
    * Should be persuasive to the person
    * Highlight a few points that best speak to the case
    * Try to be as creative as possible (be unpredictable!)

# Christian Apologetics

* Discipline of apologetics
  * Tradition used to be to use evidence to build arguments
  * Van Til's apologetic is a worldview approach - one worldview against another worldview
    * Every aspect of belief is linked with every other aspect - they come together in a set
    * Help other person become conscious of the worldview, how it is distorted, and how the Christian worldview is better
* Need to be aware of our worldview
  * Biblical metaphysic - understanding of reality
    * God created the world according to his plan
    * Man is created in God's image
    * History has a purpose and direction
    * Based upon revelation
      * Moral sense
      * Ability to reason (no room for autonomous reason)
    * Therefore we can only think after God's thoughts
      * We make sense of the world according to God's interpretation of reality
      * We don't think creatively/give things meaning
  * Biblical epistemology
    * Why believe something as true? God knows everything and reveals it to me.
    * Proper place of reason is to function in accordance with God's revelation
      * Understanding of God's revelation requires reason, but authority of God's revelation is not based on our reason
* Point of contact
  * Created in God's image
  * Already have knowledge of God in us and cannot help it
  * We suppress this (like trying to push a beachball into the water)
  * We can't suppress this successfully
    * People want to hold on to meaning, sense of happiness, love, but try to explain them in other ways
* Method
  * Must be consistent with worldview
  * If everything is created by God and reason can only function properly submitted to God, that will affect method
  * Opponent will likely believe in autonomous reason
  * Approach and methodology incompatible
* Authority and Reason
  * Problem isn't reason but who is using reason and how its used
  * Reason can only be properly accounted for in God's creation
  * Must proceed according to its nature, on the basis of God's revelation
