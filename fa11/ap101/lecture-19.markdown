# Apologetics and the Future

## Content

### General Issues

* Question of meaning
  * Bargaining, looking to other things to find solace
    * At the center of our Gospel message, we need to be tellers of how God provides a worldview
  * In Global South, mile wide and inches deep growth, so tendency to return to old religions
  * Dooyewerd - World is meaning b/c of God's revelation
* Problem of evil
  * Conflicts, wars, riots, strikes, persecution, slavery, everyday sins
  * Problem of good is the basic concern - when faced with the reality of what's gone wrong, as the Bible diagnoses it, how can we hope for anything good?
    * Philosophical answers
    * Jesus
    * Enlisting in Jesus' army to fight "the plague", the cancer intruding on creation
* Science + Technology
  * Sometimes faith and science have been great friends
    * Hard to explain rise of science without strong Christian component
  * Sometimes apparently bitter enemies, when science takes presupposition that we can explain the world without God
    * Extreme form is atheism based on scientism
  * Need to recapture this alliance, show that this is God's world
    * "Let scientists do their work, that will show for the excellencies of the one who made this world." - Machen
* The Arts + Media + "Culture"
  * Not just a luxury - we're tremendously influenced by it
  * Parts of the Reformation banished the arts from the church and minimized them in the rest of life

### Particular Issues for our time

* Globalization
  * Means many things
  * Transparency, borders, easy mobility of people and ideas and money
  * Post-cold war world of many powers interacting with one another
* Exclusivity
  * How can we claim Jesus is the way/truth/life in a plural world?
  * Plural sociologically is a good thing
  * Plural theologically is different
* Resurgence of Islam (and other religions that claim exclusivity)
  * Many faces, but unity in basic theological claims
  * Increasingly faced with theocratic religion that doesn't recognize the institutional difference between mosque and society
  * Thus fully committed Islamic societies will be run by theologians
* Contemporary forms of communication
  * Massive explosion of rapid communication through email/twitter/facebook/texting
  * Changes to some degree the way we conceive of one another - the way we consider what another person is like
    * Start to think of people as info or facts or faceless centers of data
  * Partly blessings, partly bad
  * Obvious temptations - power, pornography
  * Other great danger = thinking of people as soulless
    * Not willing to sit down, share a meal, have a person's soul unfold
* Preservation and fostering of life (and freedom?)
  * Human life is given tremendous nobility and dignity in scripture
  * Ethics of life is becoming a very big issue
  * Protecting the vulnerable, giving the voiceless a voice
  * Respecting people who don't have access to power (James 1)
* The Environment
  * Should be a major agenda point for Evangelicals
  * Proper use of creation without cruel violation of the earth
* Common Grace
  * Practicality of working alongside other people who don't share our deepest convictions
  * Kuyper's writings on common grace just published in English

* Everything should center on the hope of communion with God

## Form

* Done in and by the church
  * Consciousness of the commendation of the hope in every aspect of church life
  * Preaching centered on how to commend the Gospel to this generation
    * Equip the congregation with encouragement on how to commend the faith
  * Study groups, sunday schools, affinity groups
* Parachurch organizations
  * Focus time and resources on apologetics
  * Veritas, Trinity, Center for Public Justice, Acton Institute
  * Think Tanks attached to seminaries and universities
* Creating more institutions
  * Christian universities + colleges
  * Kuyper founded the Free University of Amsterdam in 1880
* We should each have ways to keep abreast of issues
  * Magazines, websites
  * Become skillful as communicators - master the art of persuasion
    * Read (Dickens) to learn how to communicate
    * Need to subject our souls to great writing, music, art
* Center everything in the glory of God and extension of his Kingdom
  * Practice spiritual disciplines
  * Become people of prayer
    * Pray until you're praying (Edwards)
  * If you stay away from scripture too much you'll dry up and not be able to communicate the hope that you have
