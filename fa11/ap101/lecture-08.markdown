# Logic

* Rulebook that analyzes and evaluates the human activity known as argument
* Argument is the presentation of a case
  * At the heart of apologetics
  * Setting forth reasons for what we believe and do
  * Prayer is an argument with God
* Logic is the science of argument
* Robert's Rules of Order
  * Make sure logical fallacies are avoided
  * Make sure persuasive arguments are based on correct logic
* Use of logic requires commitment to things like consistency and correct use of evidence
* Valuable tool in the interpretation of language
  * Able to unpack the meaning of a theological argument
  * Helpful in evaluating how the Bible speaks and works
  * Sets for the meaning of scripture
  * Thou shalt not steal. Embezzling is stealing. Therefore, thou shalt not embezzle.
* Doesn't add things, just calls out what's there
* Frame: "Science of commitment"
  * If you accept the premise of the argument, then you have a commitment/moral obligation to accept the conclusion
* Limitations
  * Human logic is finite and prone to error (God's is infallible) and subject to correction
  * Not complete - even the best systems of formal logic are incomplete in various ways
  * Evidences and proofs are not enough for various purposes
    * Mavroves: "Argumentation as a method of proof is not a substitute for knowledge any more than a hammer is a substitute for lumber or a needle is a substitute for cloth. Like these other tools, the techniques of valid argument are only of use if we are in possession of something else besides the tools."
  * There are apparent contradictions in human logic that we know are not ultimate contradictions
    * God knows what we're gonna pray, but pray anyway
    * Order of events in the Gospels is not consistent
* Some apologists claim that rules of logic must guide God's thinking

## Logical Order/Priorities

* Hodge: The job of systematic theology is to put the data in the Bible into a proper order
  * Paul: "Rightly order the word of truth"
  * Must order based on need
    * Westminster Confession begins with scripture because the battle of the day was one of authority
    * Geneva starts with God
    * Heidleberg starts with personal assurance
* Frame: proper order is based on application
* Barr: Word/Concept fallacy (says that every concept is embedded in a Biblical word, like sin/amartia)
  * Meaning is not so much carried in words as it is in sentences and paragraphs

## Various Types of Proofs

* Burden of proof
  * Infant baptism - NT is relatively silent
    * Paedo - continuity with OT principle of sign of circumcision. 
    * Credo - evidence in NT shows
  * Abortion - why assume unborn child is a human being?
* Deduction - premise implies the conclusion
  * If premise and argument is true, then conclusion must be true
  * When argument is valid, this is the case
* Induction - premise renders the conclusion possible or probable
  * Being with particular facts, then reason to the likelihood of general facts
  * Ex. scripture in a number of places refers to unborn children in personal terms. It never refers to them in nonpersonal ways. Therefore, its likely that they are persons.
* Reductio ad absurdum (reducing to absurdity)
  * Van Til argued from the impossibility of the contrary
  * Can't hold consistently to nonchristian view without becoming absurd
* Arguing from lesser to greater
  * If OT law is binding, how much more in the era of Christ are we held to a high standard
  * If many died by the trespass of one man, how much more did grace in Christ overflow to the many

## Logical Fallacies

* Irrelevant conclusion
* Ad hominem
  * Directed against a person instead of conclusion
  * "We can't believe him because he's not from around here."
  * Legitimate sometimes: "You brood of vipers"
