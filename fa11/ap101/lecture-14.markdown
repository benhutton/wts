# Exclusivity of the Christian Faith

* There are now 7 billion people. About a third name the name of Christ. Thus, about two thirds do not. There are thousands of religions on earth. Numerically, it would seem unfair that one be true and all the others false. Wouldn't it be better to say that they're saying the same thing with different symbols and rituals.
  * Image of the elephant with blindfolded people. No one sees the full picture or gets all of the details right. No one sees the elephant. Whoever is telling the story seems to be able to see the elephant. Why is this person not blind?
  * On the one hand, exclusivity seems unfair. On the other hand, its impossible to get around it because if you say no one religion is right, you're claiming to be right.
  * Unfairness is based on challengeable assumptions:
    * Don't judge the truth or error based on numbers. (argumentum ad populum)
    * Selectivity confuses opportunity with the love of God in election
  * Why do we feel sensitive about disagreeing with someone's religion?
    * We've decided religion is a private matter
    * Religion is major force for remedy and explanation of existence of poverty
  * Denying religion is a form of religion
    * Religion is a worldview, not just a set of prayers and rituals
  * Claims of "imposing" religion usually conflate the crusades and preaching
    * All religions have extremes
    * Christianity forbids the use of violence for advancing the kingdom
  * Difference between imposing and persuading
    * Disagreement is a good and helpful thing
* Two issues are at stake
  * On whose authority do we make a decision about which religion is true?
    * People? Or God?
    * What if the elephant speaks?
    * The true God of the universe has spoken generally and specifically
    * Van Til: "We begin frankly from authority." No reason to be embarrassed
    * Everyone begins with authority. Skeptic begins with authority of skepticism
    * Person with authority has power and right to command or commend an action
    * No such thing as living with no authority
      * Loving parents have proper authority over their children
      * Government has authority to write laws
      * Piano teacher has authority over students
    * Human authorities have no legitimacy in themselves, but derive their warrant from God
    * God does not control us automatically as though we were robots. He's built into creation an important measure of freedom and responsibility called "secondary causes".
      * No other religion has authority of this kind, but they do have insightful things to offer
  * If Christianity is not true, then we have no hope
    * God did not simply make the world and then abandon it when it tried to live without him
    * He had compassion and sent his son who suffered and died for the sake of his people
    * No other religion has anything remotely like this
    * Buddhism teaches that detachment keeps one away from the messiness of human life. Christianity teaches that God took on the messiness of human life.
    * Christianity must be true because without the death and resurrection of Christ, there is absolutely no hope for the world
* Many of the world religions are a "groping after God"
* Want to develop sound arguments against relativism
  * Don't need to develop arguments against plurality... pluralism is a social fact and a good one
  * Working in society with our exclusivist views
  * Islam is not able to cope with diversity
  * Government's purpose is to bring justice, freedom, peace to everyone
  * "Principled Pluralism"
    * Biblically principled
    * Argue in the public square for a Christian position
    * Balance of powers based on a healthy Calvinist view of sin
    * People are not above law but law is above people because God is above law
