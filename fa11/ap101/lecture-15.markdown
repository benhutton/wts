# Christianity and Science

## Dawkings (The God Delusion) vs. Lennox

Rationalism vs superstition
Religion + science don't overlap is popular only because there is no evidence
If there were evidence for faith, why call it faith?
Criticism: it doesn't do the cause of science any good to unite evolution and atheism
Religion is about science; religious claims about the universe are scientific claims; universe with God very different from universe without God
  Scientific method is how you decide if there is a God or not
  Ordinary churchgoer believes deeply in miracles
  Miracles need to be judged by strictly scientific means
Christianity is falsifiable; science is the right tools
  Have to believe in rational intelligibility of the universe before you can do any science at all
  Atheism purports to derive rationality from irrationality
  Theism says science is possible because the God who created the universe is responsible for the human mind
  Universe having a beginning was dismissed by scientists worried about creationism
  If scientists had paid attention to the Bible, they would have discovered the beginning of the universe faster
God is not improvable, just highly improbable
  Design is dead, otherwise we must say who designed the designer
  Origin of the universe is genuinely difficult - cosmology is waiting for its Darwin
  Can appeal to anthropic principle, or to multiverses - one or several universes have what it takes to give rise to man
    Give interim satisfying explanation in a way that a creator couldn't possibly be satisfying
Response:
  Anthropic principle is a truism, but doesn't answer the question about how we came to exist on it
  Darwinism explains what happens once you have life, NOT how you get life
  Created gods are by definition a delusion
    To argue that God is a delusion, we need to know what you mean by God
    Nobody believes in a created God
    The God who created the universe is uncreated and eternal
    If matter, energy, and laws of nature were always there, then he believes in the eternal; difficulty would then be with an eternal person
  The reason we can deduce two scratches on a cave wall as being from a human is because they carry meaning
  Everything comes from the mind of the planners
Teaching children that faith is a virtue is evil
  Only a minority of religious people are bad or do bad things
  Teaching: Don't need to justify what you do, just need to point to "that's my faith"
  Faith is a terrible thing because it justifies the performance of terrible acts
  Don't believe something because you're told it - look for the evidence and trust it
Response:
  Christ prohibited use of physical force to advance Christianity
  Imagine a world with no Stalin, Mao, or Polpot
  For Marx, the criticism of religion was the foundation of all criticism
  If we are to differentiate between atheists, we must differentiate between Christians
