# Argument for the Christian Faith

* Trancendental method - determining what presuppositions are necessary for predication in order that the world might be intelligible to us
  * Only one truth - the ontological trinity - as the basis of knowledge
  * Begin frankly from authority, but not a shouting match or a vicious circle; circular reasoning but not a circular argument
  * Method is indirect - necessary consideration of preconditions before speaking clearly about facts and evidences
  * Don't need to constantly use the term or refer to the concept of presuppositions
  * "Willing to start with any fact as a proximate starting point"
* What facts do we begin with? 
  * Point of contact = reminding unbelievers of what they already know
  * 2 basic moves (not necessarily sequential)
    * Move to the unbeliever's ground for argument sake to show how it is untenable on its own strength - **disclosure**
      * Nonchristian philosophy can't cohere - there has to be a chink in the armor where if pushed, it reduces to absurdity
      * Disconnect between the claim and the life
        * Christianity is true and therefore the contrary is impossible
        * Rationalism and irrationalism
          * Rationalism holds that reason is the only ultimate and the only reality whereby we can make sense of the world
            * Man who claimed to know (or need to know) everything about everything - wouldn't use telephone until he understood it
            * Descartes - "if my generation does not access all truth, surely my children's generation will"
            * AJ Ayer - verification principle - if a statement is made that cannot be verified, then it is a nonsense statement. (eg, "There is a God"). Problem: verification principle is not subject to verification
            * "No double positive can ever be a negative" - "yeah, yeah" - forgot tone
            * Freud - "same laws govern the motion of the universe, the bursting of a soap bubble, and the human mind" - to fiancee: "lets just love each other irrationally"
            * Need to take a leap of faith somewhere, which is irrational - find what this is and expose it
          * Irrational takes many forms: there is no meaning, life is absurd, the world makes no sense
            * "There is no truth!" - "Is that true?"
            * John Cage - a composer who called himself an inventor, believed music should reflect a purely chance universe. 10 radios + thumb tacks, 4:33 of silence. Had avocation of micology (fungi)... "If I did my mushrooms on the basis of my music, I would die"
            * Ultimately rationalistic
        * Maslov - hierarchy of needs
          * Japanese prison camp revival - man confesses to lost shovel - Maslov is wrong, not wired for survival, cannot be reduced to animals, hearts longing for relationship with God
        * Gratitude
          * The worst moment for an atheist is when he's genuinely thankful but has nobody to thank
          * Chesterton - encountered "The Pessimist Society" at art school, realized there was something deeply wrong - at the heart of lack of humility was ingratitude - realized that he was thankful, used this to hang on to religion
        * Amazement
        * Auden - problem is that we don't have enough money, too many barriers; if barriers were removed, there would be flourishing
          * At a movie, heard people yelling "Go Hitler, kill the Poles"
          * Realized that he could no longer be a liberal humanist - heard humans shouting out pure evil - wondered why he thought people could be evil
        * Total relativism until its the thing you care most about
          * Animal rights
          * Somewhere an absolute has to have snuck in
        * Professor Eimes at Oxford - pessimist who thought the world was going to end, thought it would be better to be shot. Didn't really appreciate a student offering to shoot him.
        * Jesus with Rich Young Ruler - almost everyone has something that tends to be more precious than God
