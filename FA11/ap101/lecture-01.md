AP101 Lecture 1 - September 13

Apologetics is characteristic of every department

  - Element of defence and of commendation in every area

## Why apologetics is declining

Karl Barth - Swiss pastor-theologian

 - Opposed German liberalism
 - True Christian liberalism is where the wholely-other God is encountered by the wholely-present Christ
 - Fundamental problem with his dialectical theology
 - Barth waged war against apologetics.  For half a century, apologetics went into hibernation.
  - Apologetics takes unbelief too seriously and dignifies it as a rival religion.  Elevating unbelief to a status it should never have.
  - Can't argue people into the kingdom.  Need to let the HS do it.  Need to meet Christ.

Spurgeon thought he didn't like apologetics either

 - "I question whether the defenses of the Gospel are not sheer impertinences.  The Gospel does not need defending.  If Jesus is not alive and can't defend it, then Christianity is in a bad state."
 - Don't argue for the Gospel - it has its own power and naked symplicity
 - Like defending a Lion

Apologetics complicates things by putting argument between the power of the Gospel and the recipient

God has commissioned us to be ambassadors and speak well of Him

 - Paul did this all the time
 - Some thing that Paul's sermon to the Athenians was wrong, and that Paul corrected himself in Corith.  No textual warrant for this.

No such thing as a "nakedly simple" Gospel.

Helpful corrective that went too far:

 - A lot of verbal defense
 - Needed community, love, healing

Apologetics isn't merely arguing against the overflow of an unbelieving heart

Today: resurgence of apologetics

 - challenges from Islam, new atheism, etc. need a response
 - European Leadership Forum - sponsors debates, tours, lectures

Can't be clever at argument and not care about people's souls

## Why apologetics should be engaged in

### Perennial questions that come to challenge Christianity

 - Who am I?
 - Is there meaning?
 - Why do bad things happen to people?
 - How can you believe only one religion is true? How can you be right and so many people be wrong?
 - Didn't Darwin refute Genesis?
 - What about the Crusades?
 - What about missionaries?  Isn't this just colonialism?
 - Isn't the Gospel against freedom and pleasure?
 - Doesn't the Gospel oppress blacks/women/gays?

People have a hard time separating between a persuasive argument done in a civil manner, and propaganda.

### Questions not being asked that should be asked

 - Should I not stop and think "what am I doing here" rather than being distracted?
 - Pascal: Why is God so great?  Why am I so miserable?
 - Faustian bargain: trade soul for present things. Tries to distract you from realizing your mortality. Should be asking questions instead. Apologetics tries to rescue people out of this.
 - How can I be right with God?

### Reasons from church history

 - Persecution

  - Justin Martyr (d. 165) - wrote apologies
  - 20th and 21st centuries have seen more Christian blood shed than any century previously
  - Christians are most persecuted religious group
  - Calvin's *Institutes* are written as an apologetic

 - Heresy

## Tomorrow: biblical justification
